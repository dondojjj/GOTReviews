1,1,Winter Is Coming,That was the coolest title sequence ever. 
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"""The things I do for love."""
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"As soon as I saw Joffrey, I wanted to smack that kid in the face."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I'm slightly worried it might be too confusing for people who haven't read the books. Hard to tell though, I can't really see it through a non readers eyes."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Oh man, Bran's wolf is so cute.  I hope to see the others next episode. "
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Did anyone else find Viserys to be surprisingly well played? The ""Wake the dragon"" line didn't even sound strange either!"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,I loved it. That Dany/Drogo scene was brutal though :(
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Oh my god. So Fucking Good. I've torn through the first three books, beginning the forth, over the last month and it has to be one of the best works of literature I've ever read. So, I've been as excited as tits for the HBO premiere, and it did not disappoint in any aspect whatsoever. Arya, Tyrion, Jon, Bran, Daenerys and Viserys, it's an incredible experience to see these characters brought to life with such stunning accuracy to how I see them existing.

And The Wall and Winterfell, kudos to HBO for doing such a fantastic job creating these sets as they did. Wow. Can't wait to see Grey Wind and Ghost in action as the series progresses.

'the things I do for love'
"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,And I love how Arya was running around with a helmet on and smacked Sansa in the face with a piece of meat.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I like most of the casting. Especially Ned, Tyrion, and Bran"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Anyone else think Joffrey and Viserys were cast perfectly? I'm already wanting to kick their shit in, and its only the first episode. Jaime plays the subtle arrogancy decent as well.

Daenerys' actress is really pretty too. I don't say that because she was nude, but she's just beautiful."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Overall it was pretty damn good. The costumes and sets were amazing! Some of the acting felt a little cheesy, but I think that's because I've read the books so many times...

Disappointed that we didn't see Theon kick the head after Ned lopped it off..."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Love the title sequence. I love the gears and cogs motif. I love Tyrion and Jon Snow. Adore Ned. 

Also, Daenarys is fucking hot. What an ass."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,was the guy with the crazy wolf-like helmet supposed to be the hound?  it didnt look like his face was messed up.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Ok, book reader here.  I think the second time I watched this episode things went a lot smoother, I couldn't turn off my brain the first time and kept thinking about all the differences between the book and the show.  TL;DR loved it.

Here are some things I really wanted to see, small but when I didn't see it the first time around I was disappointed.  I think second time around I was just trying to watch the show more than analyze it and it turned out a lot better.  Spoiler tags everywhere cause better safe than sorry I guess.

* [The Others kill Ser Waymar Royce in the beginning, then he in turn kills Will.  The deserter is Gared, not Will.](/spoiler)  I guess it doesn't really matter since it's a short intro but the way things worked out confused the hell out of me at first.
* Theon didn't get much in, [would love to have seen him kick the head after the beheading](/spoiler), as others have already commented.
* Bran [doesn't climb with his shoes on, which is significant only because he can sneak up on Cersei and Jaime without being heard](/spoiler).  That's why Bran climbing seemed weird to me at first.
* Jon Snow did get a lot of screen time, but there were two specific things I wished they had kept in.   [When they first find the direwolves, Theon is an ass when Jon finds his albino wolf pup but Jon doesn't say anything back.  It would be really satisfying to hear him say ""I think not, Greyjoy.  This one belongs to me.""  It didn't seem significant that the bastard's wolf is different than the others in the show although they have plenty of time for that later.](/spoiler)
* The other part I really like is when Jon and Tyrion talk [after Jon blurts out that he'd never father a bastard during the dinner.  When he leaves the hall he talks with Tyrion and Ghost tags along.  After talking for a bit Tyrion says ""All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.""  You can then see very clearly why Jon would have a rapport with Tyrion.](/spoiler)
* I wanted to see a scene with all the children [naming their wolves.  I suppose they can still do it, those dogs look great.](/spoiler)
* Ned never really appears to say that he's against becoming the hand of the king when he's with Catelyn in their bedchamber.  All the stuff gets said mostly by Cat and Maester Luwin.  In the book Ned is [completely against it and Catelyn is trying to convince him to become the hand from the get go due to political reasons.  Here's where you really get to see Ned's honest apolitical nature and you see how Catelyn is more shrewd in that regard.  After they get the letter Ned is even more against going south and Catelyn is even more sure that he has to.](/spoiler)
* Cersei and Jaime [talk about Ned becoming the hand and how Arryn's wife fled King's Landing while Bran is climbing.  Very heavy hints about the killing of Jon Arryn here.  The reason Jaime pushes Bran out the window and the assassination attempt later is because they're worried about what he may have overheard as well as what he saw.](/spoiler)
* Peter Dinklage's O face is fucking awesome.

Ok, /pedantic.  Obviously a lot of these things probably had to be cut or whatnot to fit and make everything work.  Here's hoping for more great stuff to come!"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Emilia Clarke is so beautiful.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Look at all you innocent children. So cute.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,LOVE the theme song.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,ITS STARTING! I CANT STOP SMILING OR WRITING IN CAPS!!
1,1,Winter Is Coming,That was just awesome. Watching it again right now.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Dude in the prologue (Gared? it's been a while since I read that) looks like Matt Damon.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I really enjoyed Sean Bean's first delivery of ""Winter is coming"".  He's a fantastic actor, one that should have gotten a Hollywood leading role years ago.  

When Ned says the phrase again later with Benjen, it has almost an entirely different meaning, too, with a nice twist to it.  For me, these are important because in a few years time, I'll distinctly remember only the most key moments in beloved shows (mostly since I tend to not rewatch them over and over), and getting those right is vital for my fondest memories of stuff like this."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Overall, I think it was a good start. At least on par with the Pacific. My only real issue is that I feel that it skimmed over some important back story. But I guess thats the nature of television.

If I could change one thing, I would have included the notion of the Jamie as the Kingslayer/Oathbreaker to provide some more depth to Team Stark's mistrust of Clanister(Clan Lanister! Get it!). Despite the viewer knowing that the Lanisters are up to no good, I felt that the Starks didn't really have a strong basis for their angst. That whole dynamic just needed something else to make it believable. "
1,1,Winter Is Coming,This is history
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Totally called the first episode ending with bran falling.  
1,1,Winter Is Coming,I’ve come to pay my respects.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Did anyone else think Rodrik Cassel’s facial hair made it look like he was wearing some kind of weird hair bonnet?
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"My favorite scene was Jamie going from hovel to hovel listening for women moaning so he could find Tyrion.

Ok. I am geeking out. I think they can actually do this. They put a LOT in the first episode. Not only did they have to build up an interest in the audience but they had to make everything interesting and still remain true to the book, which they DID.

"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Anyone spot [Mance Rayder](/spoiler) at the feast? I was keeping a look out but didn't see anyone who looked like it could be him.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,I'm a bit surprised they didn't point out that the stag is the sigil of House Baratheon while the direwolf is the sigil of House Stark. I felt so much meaning was lost when Ned just casually drew out the broken antler from the wolf's neck.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Am I the only one who thinks that Lena Headey aka Sarah Connor was a great choice for Cersei?

She is beautiful and definitely pulls off the elegant yet cunning thing very well.

P.S. Can't wait for episode 2! Although it did kinda seem like they were moving a bit fast."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,More than I could ever have asked for. Loved it. Going to be a long week.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I have to say I am loving reading the comments here particularly the interactions between readers and non-readers. Hearing non-reader speculation is also very cool. And I don't mean that mockingly. It reminds me of my first thoughts on the plot points and sort of brings me back to when I first read the books.
"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"The casting was absolutely fantastic. I hate Cersei right off the bat, conniving bitch, i love Tyrion and the Targaryens are brilliant. They've done very, very well. Can't wait to see the rest."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,I loved it. My wife and friends that came over were having trouble following it. They didn't seem as psyched as I was when it was over. I hope it has the staying power to see the series through. 
1,1,Winter Is Coming,So what are the ratings numbers?
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I liked it and am hopeful.

A little impressed with how very masculine Drogo was.  Catelyn already on my nerves.  Casting has been great."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Perspective from one who hadn't read the books. (At time of this post I've seen the whole series and am now about 350 pages into the first book)

It took a few tries to make it through the prologue scene. I found it rather stark (no pun intended) and thought it might end up being as cheesy as Camelot.

Once I made it through that, and decided one day to just sit through the whole episode, I really started to like it. I don't have any idea who was who and how everything connects, but I loved the sets and the acting and just kept watching.

Then I see Tyrion and thought, ""We meet this character as a dwarf getting a blowjob? This'll be interesting!"" I liked his roguish attitude and his wit. Then when I saw his interaction with Jon, I thought, ""Alright, that dude is cool as hell.""

I felt this sense of dread about ""winter is coming"" so they conveyed a lot of heaviness without really explaining much, which is good acting.

I really liked the characters of Bran and Arya. Sersa and Joffrey were definitely not likable. 

Still trying to figure out the guy I've nicknamed ""Grampy Sideburns"" who stands around looking gruff and important but says next to nothing. Reminds me a lot of Thufir Hawat from Dune.

Viserys was immediately detestable and Daenerys was definitely a character you feel bad for...and turned on by.

The direwolf pups are just too cool."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"What did Ned say to Jaime at the end there, in that brief conversation about the tournament?"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,I really enjoyed it. My only criticism is that they made Catelyn a wuss. That was a little disappointing.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I watched the episode with my roommate and his girlfriend.  She was the only one among us who had not read the books and was asking a lot of questions during the episode.  

It annoyed me little because many of the questions were valid and the episode did seem like it could be confusing to someone that never read the books.  "
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Benjen did not look at all like my mental image.  But I can see why he was cast - the actor does look a fair bit like Sean Bean.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"damn that was infinitely better than i expected it to be. What I love about it is how lean it is - I love how detailed the books are, but the episode made me forget all about the things they skimped over. Brilliant cinematography and that opening credits sequence is probably the best one in a long time. Kudos be to the showrunners who can actually satisfy a rabid Martin fanbase. "
1,1,Winter Is Coming,[deleted]
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Damn, those were the days…"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,And why was Sansa so old?  I think the visible age gap between the two sisters was too large
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I watched. I haven't read the books. Can someone explain what ""The Wall"" was?"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Anyone who thought the wolf pups looked a bit small? Exactly how big was the wolf pups in the books? I thought Bran's looked awfully small when you imagine that [he will rip out the attackers throat later](/spoiler).
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I was thoroughly impressed by the grandeur of the sets and production quality. The visuals were spot on.

The acting was also pretty good, though I felt Robert Baraetheon (the king) could have been more imposing. In his youth he was portrayed by the books as as immensely physically imposing, and even though he let himself go over the years, I couldn't see any of that in the actor they cast. Standing face to face with Ned, he actually looked quite weaksauce.

Did they write [Rickon, the youngest Stark](/spoiler) out of the show or did I miss him completely? They mentioned five direwolves (+1 for Jon Snow), which should cover all of Ned's trueborn.

Generally, the show feels a bit rushed and choppy so far, but I realize this season is only supposed to be 10 episodes long. I hope they show can maintain casual viewer interest because with all these characters, backgrounds, and geographies, it might get a bit confusing.

Must watch again!"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"The main thing that bothered me was the [lack of animal imagery. Seriously. The scene were they saw the stag dead from mountain lions didn't have the full effect that it was supposed to. I don't remember hearing anything that had to do with Lannisters being lions. All the forshadowing of the stags getting killed by the lion and the stag killing the direwolf was gone. It only seemed like they saw a stag kill a wolf to find the pups. If they don't put in more of that animal stuff, I will be mad](/spoiler)"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"and who are you, the proud lord said..."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I and my friends who have read the books LOVED it. My friend who hadn't read the books also enjoyed it, but was asking tons of questions throughout, which frustrated the rest of us. We were hoping he'd wait until the episode was over."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I thought the episode was great. They did a good job of cramming a lot in without feeling rushed. With that said, it's hard to say how non-readers feel about the pace. The two people I watched with who hadn't seen it both really liked it though.

The only characters who were disappointing in appearance were Catelyn and Cersei. Catelyn should be as attractive as Cersei and Cersei should be a near supermodel. I do think acting wise though that Cersei did a great job. She definitely looks regal. Not sold on Catelyn's portrayal, but I will take what amounts to only 1 potential miss in my eyes."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,[deleted]
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Too much sex
1,1,Winter Is Coming,I'm glad I read the book first. They did quite a bit of snipping but managed to get some key points in the beginning.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Damn it's been a long time since I've read the books. I don't remember King's Landing being right next to the sea.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Sandor Clegane didn't seem nearly scarred enough to me.
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I was fairly impressed with how they managed to explain the intersecting, twisted family trees and relationships of Game of Thrones. The little bits of extra dialogue and interaction between the characters was pretty clever for the most part. I am sure it is still confusing to an outsider, but the effort was pretty well done."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,I loved this so much. I'd seen the hype surrounding the show and didn't get it. I didn't read the book or really look into what it was about. On the surface I just saw a show about medieval times. Yawn. I caught the first episode and I was pleasantly surprised. I want to read the book(s?) but I don't want to ruin the show. I'll wait until after it's run. 
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I watched the episode with my wife who has never read the books (and never will). As a fan, I loved every moment of it, but the intro section with the white walkers and gore really threw my wife. She watched the rest of the episode expecting monster slaying and stuff. It didn't confuse me because I know the story but I see how this can if you haven't read the books. "
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I found it to be excellent, although I felt the nudity was excessive and not needed, I mean I don't really want to be horny when watching the show.

Even with that said, I think Daenerys was casted excellently"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"I am disappointed. First, the music was bad, I just couldn't listen to it. I can't imagine why spent so much money on the show, when it has just ordinary music. Second, the episode seemed like a lot of previews, it wasn't consistent at all. I don't think that people who didn't read the book will stick to it, too much things without any background - I think it was confusing for most. Third, why Daenerys doesn't have violet eyes? 
Maybe it's just me, but I imagined it totally different and now I'm totally unexcited about second episode.
"
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Did anybody else picture the troll face when Ser Waymar Royce said: ""Do the dead frighten you?"""
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Alright, buncha shit I want to break down. I'm kinda drunk an/or high at the moment so sorry for whatever I'm about to vomit in the form of words.

Show was good, opening squence fucking awesome.

Arya, Jon, Viscerys, and Jamie are all awesome... I kinda wanted to punch a goat when I first saw Jamie but that's exactly how you should feel. Jamie. Douche.

Danny, Drogo, Baratheon - These guys were pretty atrocious overall as far as acting.  I kind of can give Danny as pass since I get to see her boobies but yeah the acting is almost bad enough to cancel that out.

Greyjoy - Horrible, F-.  I swear all he did the entire episode was needlessly stare/eye-fuck anyone that was willing to make eye contact.  He's like a douchier Hayden Christansen. 

The ""Dire Wolves"" - WHOOZA GOO BUBBA! WHOOZA GOO BUBBA!?

OH Eddard - I like Sean Bean and all but he really kind of phones in the serious intensity a bit much.  Like ok yeah Eddard == Serious but the intensely serious conversations was a bit much.  And the scene where Maester Pucell and Catelyn are telling him about becoming the new hand... might be the worst thing I've ever seen.  Wicked bad exposition.

Incest and rape... don't try it at home."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,Wow
1,1,Winter Is Coming,I forgot we had Ben here…
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"Well, this aged interestingly."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,watching thiss now for first time ever. :)
1,1,Winter Is Coming,"This is my first viewing. I resisted when it first came out. I may have gotten 15 minutes into this first episode and said nope. But I’m back again because now the house of dragon is what everyone is watching so here I go.

First impressions. There are so many characters it’s hard to keep track of who is who and who is with whose family, etc."
1,1,Winter Is Coming,finally watched this. love being 11 years late
1,1,Winter Is Coming,can’t believe how bad they fumbled after starting so well
1,2,The Kingsroad,"It was hard to watch Arya throw a rock at Nymeria and make her leave. I mean, it was hard to read about it, too, but seeing it was so sad. And Lady's death...god. So sad. :("
1,2,The Kingsroad,"RIP, Lady. "
1,2,The Kingsroad,"The goodbye scene between Jon and Arya was the best of the episode, I think. Their affection for each other was very believable. "
1,2,The Kingsroad,"I know he hasn't said a lot yet but I think the Hound is going to be great. The way he carries himself and how casually he talks about riding a kid down... Good casting again. Though I only know him as Micheal in Hot Fuzz. >_>

Oh and of course Arya's great. "
1,2,The Kingsroad,"I loved the symbolism of the whole episode.  The idiot daughter who cares only about being a princess betrays the family and thus it's her wolf that pays the price.  She's no longer a Stark.

Speaking of which, where was Snow's white wolf?  Didn't see it.

Tyrion was awesome as always.
"
1,2,The Kingsroad,So I personally thought this episode was better than the first. I think the pacing was a lot better since they weren't introducing a new character every 5 seconds.
1,2,The Kingsroad,[deleted]
1,2,The Kingsroad,I just want to reiterate: Arya is fuckin' awesome.
1,2,The Kingsroad,Can someone make a gif of Joffrey being slapped from now until the end of time?
1,2,The Kingsroad,I laughed out loud everytime Tyrion bitch slapped Joffery.
1,2,The Kingsroad,"That prince kid annoys the living heck out of me... 

The way they ran the butcher's son down...so sad.... :("
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Loved this episode. I agree that it was better than the first, though I truly enjoyed that episode as well.

The scenes with Ned and Robert sitting at the table and Jon and Tyrion at the campfire were fantastic. Love seeing this world come alive.

And I will go ahead and join the chorus here of Arya's badassery. Very rare to find such great child actors."
1,2,The Kingsroad,[deleted]
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Characters I can't wait to meet:

Renly Baratheon

Ser Barristan Selmy

Ser Gregor ""The Mountain That Rides"" Clegane

Ser Loras Tyrell

Yoren

Roose Bolton

Ser Brynden ""Blackfish"" Tully

Bronn

Tywin Lannister

Prince Rhaegar Targaryen (hope there is a flashback to the Ruby Crossing)

Stannis Baratheon (doubt he will be in this season)

Shae

Jaq'hen H'ghar

Hodor

BERIC MOTHER FUCKING DONDARRION

...Also, has Jaime Lannister been referred to as the Kingslayer in the show yet?"
1,2,The Kingsroad,I think it has become painfully obvious that 10 episodes waaay too few.
1,2,The Kingsroad,[deleted]
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Sansa. Ohhhhhhhhhh, why are you such an ignorant fluff-for-brains? "
1,2,The Kingsroad,"This episode definitely felt rushed.  There were several moments that lost most of their emotional impact ([arya tossing rocks at nymeria, micha's death, introducing payne](/spoiler)) by being to quick or brief.  I think, in general, pacing is going to be a problem with this show.  They have a lot to cover, and they need to cover it while creating an impression that a significant amount of time (weeks and months) is passing.  It's not going to be easy.

One thing I really do like though is the Ned/Robert relationship.  The books talk about what good friends Ned and Robert are, but don't do a good job of showing it. HBO is doing a much better job of making these people feel like old buddies."
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Oh man... Ned's face when Robert mentions ""your bastard's mother."" Makes the theorist in me squirm!!

BTW... anyone else think that Lena Headey is sort of just phoning in her lines in this episode? I know Cersei is sort of a cold-hearted bitch, but it really just sounded like she was reading the lines straight from the script in this episode.
"
1,2,The Kingsroad,"I heard some bad early reviews about this episode, not sure why. I enjoyed it very much. I must say, much as in the books, Tyrion will definitely be one of my favorite part of the series. Peter Dinklage is awesome."
1,2,The Kingsroad,I noticed that the opening credits sequence changes every episode to reflect the new locations we see.  So now I'll never have a reason to fast forward through a single minute of this amazing show.
1,2,The Kingsroad,"I just want to say that Sandor is indeed, creepy."
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Cannot say enought good things about Tyrion and Peter Dinklage!

Also, Does anyone else feel that when they rip the dialogue right out of the books, it feels the most genuine?  Specifically, my favorite part of this episode was Tyrion's dialogue, especially the beginning of the episode."
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Does anyone else just look at Theon and [absolutely want to strangle his smug little face for everything he is going to do later in series?](/spoiler)

Above may be a book 3 spoiler, can't remember exactly when the referenced events occur."
1,2,The Kingsroad,">You let that little girl disarm you?

Ha ha ha ha ha!"
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Wait, so what is this nonsense about Cersei and Robert having had a son before Joffrey that died?  Book 1 Spoilers: [She specifically mentions his dark black hair and the fact that he looked just like Robert.  I assume this is just setting up non-readers for Ned's later investigation into the differences between Robert's bastards and his ""legitimate"" children.](/spoiler)  But seriously, wasn't there a way to do this without inventing a new character?

Or maybe they're just trying to show us more clearly that Cersei did actually love Robert at one point.  Perhaps it's both."
1,2,The Kingsroad,"I watched this with my girlfriend, and she commented on the girl-on-girl scene with Dany and her handmaiden, saying that it was unnecessary. 

Because I read the books, all I could say was ""That's her job! It was totally necessary!"". "
1,2,The Kingsroad,When did Catelyn become a detective?
1,2,The Kingsroad,Never read the books  but after seeing this episode I'll definitely stay tuned 
1,2,The Kingsroad,I'm pissed at the look of the Valyrian steel used in the show. I was hoping Ice was just a one time flaw but tonights dagger seals it. [How are they going to make Joff and Jamie's swords look right if the steel is not rippled like Damascus steel?](/spoiler)
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Does anybody else feel like Kit, Jon's actor, seems rather... dull at times? There are points where he plays the character perfectly (the Jon-Arya scene, for example), but there are other times where he just comes off as... derp. 

Maybe it's just the way his voice is, but he just seems slow. "
1,2,The Kingsroad,Can anyone remind me which character it is that consoles Sansa as Lady is about to be killed? I want to think he's a major player but I can't remember who he is?
1,2,The Kingsroad,I'm really enjoying this show. I can't believe I have to wait another week for the next episode...
1,2,The Kingsroad,"I don't know how i feel about them conflating Lady's death with Bran waking up versus [The Dream waking him up](/spoiler), though I suppose [they can show his dream in the next episode instead](/spoiler)."
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Pretty cool how they ended the episode, but also a little regrettable. It set up an expectation that will not deliver a satisfactory pay-off in next weeks episode. People who haven't read the book are not going to be happy. "
1,2,The Kingsroad,"The one thing that bugged me about the episode was Lady's death, I remember all the dire wolves suddenly howling when she dies."
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Just my 2 cents on Caitlyn Stark. She's so annoying and whiny. I loathed the character in the books, and the TV character even more so. I don't think that George Martin creating her was a bad thing or all that, but its just that whenever I hear the constant bitching/moaning, I just want to punch her face on the tv. "
1,2,The Kingsroad,Why don't we ever see john snow's dire wolf?
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Didn't like the end and the omission of [Bran's dream where he is falling](/spoiler). Other than that they stuck to some of the dialogue very well, especially Tyrion's"
1,2,The Kingsroad,Watching Joffrey get the taste smacked out of his mouth repeatedly made my already huge amount of love for this series sky-rocket!
1,2,The Kingsroad,"This episode... so intense.
I almost cried at the end.
So friggin awesome.
EDIT: can't wait until they [crown Robb](/spoiler)"
1,2,The Kingsroad,As someone watching for the first time. I hate everyone.
1,2,The Kingsroad,No Renly or Barristan Selmy?!?!?!?
1,2,The Kingsroad,The scene where Bran's Direwolf (Summer?) defends Bran and his mother was full of pure win. And Arya's Direwolf attacking that whiny piece of crap was also fun to watch. Though I wish it ripped out Sansa's throat while it was at it.
1,2,The Kingsroad,"[Wait. Cersei basically said she actually had a son from Robert. ""A black haired beauty."" ](/spoiler)

Unless I'm grossly misremembering, that was not the case in the books. 

[Probably just a way for the TV audience to start guessing that Joffrey and the others are not Robert's kids.](/spoiler)

Interesting."
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Loved the episode but some difference from the book:

The confrontation between Jon and Cat is toned down in the show. :(

The order in which Jon says good bye is reversed. He meets Arya first and then goes sees Bran. 

LOL at Cat's detective work, no way is she so smart in the books. 

And WTF at Lady not getting the honorable death and burial!

Also, Ghost needs more airtime, I wanna see that white fuzzy thing!!! I think they didnt wanna show three attacks by the direwolves and portray them as overly bad, but come on, they are cute!

Also, that Robert and Ned scene happens before they leave Winterfell (My memory might be failing me with this).

And correct me if I am mistaken here, but why is Tyrion waking up with the dogs?? Isnt he in the Library reading the whole night? "
1,2,The Kingsroad,"I wish people would stop mentioning [R+L=J](/spoiler) in /r/gameofthrones. Most people who haven't read the book don't even know who Rhaegar is yet, and people can't help themselves when it comes to spoilers. To find out so early really ruins a big part of what makes Game of Thrones amazing."
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Is anyone else annoyed how much they downplay new characters?  Every couple minutes, they introduce someone new and fail to say their name."
1,2,The Kingsroad,"I like that the script is giving Jaime additional screen time. In the book, a lot of his characterization early on comes from other characters talking about him, and since they understandably cut that it's good they replaced it with new lines for him."
1,2,The Kingsroad,Why aren't people upvoting this? It needs to get to the front page!
1,2,The Kingsroad,Episode 2 reminded me of the [relative peace](/spoiler) that existed in episode 1's timeframe...  [and it only gets continually worse from here; I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for having to visually see all the turmoil to come](/spoiler)
1,2,The Kingsroad,I thought one of the Dothraki slave girls was Teyla. I had to look it up. Random Stargate: Atlantis cameos as the Dothraki would have seemed a bit out of place for an HBO series... But would have totally been awesome.
1,2,The Kingsroad,was the part where Cersei tells Cat about her dead child in the book?  I don't remember.
1,2,The Kingsroad,[Loved](/spoiler) it. Especially the [hatred](/spoiler) in [Arya's](/spoiler) eyes after they [sentenced Lady](/spoiler) to [die](/spoiler)
1,2,The Kingsroad,"When the fuck are Stark going to turn against the king? I already hate the fuck out of all of them but the Dwarf. Queen needs to die, Good looking douche needs to die, tween son needs to die.  The redhead girl has no morals either, putting her crush for the prince over her family, even their lives. Poor wolf :(

4 left right? Where are the other 2?"
1,2,The Kingsroad,">You let that little girl disarm you?

Ha ha ha ha ha!"
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Here are two positive thoughts:

-Tonight's progression with Danerys was good
-The Direwolves are so fucking cute

My Negative thoughts:

-Sansa's actor is not very good

-Maybe they made Tyrion a little too small? His head doesn't look right

EDIT: Woah didn't realise that it wasn't CG, thanks guys!"
1,2,The Kingsroad,[deleted]
1,2,The Kingsroad,"Also, knowing a little bit about the books, I guess what happens with the dragon eggs is obvious.  But I'm curious, was it that clearly foreshadowed in the first book?  Because they seem to make it *very fucking obvious* in the show.

1,3,Lord Snow,The scene of Arya learning the sword made this entire episode.
1,3,Lord Snow,If this series gets any better my TV will explode. 
1,3,Lord Snow,"I love that they did a shot of Tyrion ""pissing off the edge of the world,"" just as he planned. Nice touch"
1,3,Lord Snow,Tyrion sword-fighting Ser Thorne with a crab fork was sorely missed :'(
1,3,Lord Snow,"Ser Barristan seems excellently cast, and he played the role brilliantly. I loved the scene with him, Jaime and drunk Robert - [Book](/b ""you could almost see him thinking 'Gods, I miss Rhaegar...'"")"
1,3,Lord Snow,"Is it just me or was this show very well cast.   Most of the characters look just like I imagined them while reading the books.
"
1,3,Lord Snow,The last scene with Syrio and Arya is one of my favourites so far.
1,3,Lord Snow,"A part from the book that should not have been left out - [Book Spoiler](/b ""Daenerys was supposed to give the order to take Visery's horse, which was a huge building of her character."")"
1,3,Lord Snow,3 episodes in and my gut reaction about Tyrion and Arya being very well cast has been confirmed 3 times over!
1,3,Lord Snow,Carcetti!
1,3,Lord Snow,"Oh, and Viserys looked perfectly crazy tonight."
1,3,Lord Snow,I like the emphasis on the impact the wars had on Ned and Robert. The end with Ned having a minor flashback and Robert bemoaning the stupid Tarly boy give a depth that would have been easy to lose changing mediums. 
1,3,Lord Snow,[deleted]
1,3,Lord Snow,If you're going to be a cripple...
1,3,Lord Snow,"I really liked the scene with the old woman (I believe it's Old Nan) and Bran. She had a great monologue about the winter. Also the discussion the older members of the Night's Watch had about winter was interesting and helped me better understand how exactly the seasons work.

Tyrion, Arya, and Ned continue to stand out. I really liked Littlefinger too (Carcetti!), another well cast role. The sword instructor is also pretty awesome."
1,3,Lord Snow,"God, I love the guy playing Benjen Stark. Sigh."

1,3,Lord Snow,"I really enjoyed the casting of the Old Bear :) He has the mixture of orange and white whiskers, just as I imagined."
1,3,Lord Snow,Syrio!! I was so excited to see him.
1,3,Lord Snow,"I really dislike the lack of wolves, and talking crows. :("
1,3,Lord Snow,"If I had to nitpick, another thing that bugged me a bit was the way it was cut to make it seem like [TV Spoiler](/s ""Catelyn is heading back North before Tyrion is heading back South."")

1,3,Lord Snow,That elevator ride up to the summit of The Wall? Nerd chills. 
1,3,Lord Snow,Interesting choice for Syrio. (sp?) I pictured him as tall and lithe. 
1,3,Lord Snow,I got unreasonably excited seeing Samwell Tarley in the previews at the end of the episode.
1,3,Lord Snow,"Interesting.  Were we ever told that [Book Spoilers](/b Ser Jorah is a traitor this early?  because it was made pretty obvious tonight).

Also I've seen no comments yet on Maester Aemon who i thought was superbly cast.  Speaking of the wall, the view from the top was pretty well done, even by the impressive standards of the series.  It really gave you the sense that you were standing on the edge of the world.
"
1,3,Lord Snow,"A rare relatively upbeat episode. Nobody died, got hurled from a window, or had to murder a puppy. I was glad for the reprieve. [Book Spoiler](/b ""But sadly I know it won't last long. Got some more unfortunate events coming our way."")"
1,3,Lord Snow,"First, the big things.  Pacing is still an ENORMOUS problem.  The scene where Ned [TV Spoiler](/s ""learns about the crown's debts"") was completely ruined by the breakneck pace, and a number of other scenes felt rushed.  If this keeps up, it is going to ruin the show.  Almost as important is the wolves.  We aren't seeing nearly enough of them considering [Book Spoiler](/b ""how important they become later in the story"").  They don't need to be doing anything, but they should be in the background at all times, in bran's bed and following Jon and Robb around.

Now the little stuff.  Having Tyrion give Jon the armory speech instead of Donnel Noy was a good move, new characters need to be kept to a minimum.  But having Pip and Gren in the room with them while Jon talks about them as if they weren't even there was a bizarre choice.  Having Maester Aemon try to get Tyrion to help is just wrong.  It isn't his place and completely contrary to his character.  DAE think Syrio was too young?  Don't get me wrong, the guy was fantastic, but I always saw him as older.  Selmy was awesome, and I like the KG armor.  Can't wait for the Hand's Tourney and the ludicrous finery.  The scene with Robert, Jaime and Selmy was fun but I'm not sure it really added anything.  The scene with Cersi and Joff, however, did a great job of showing off both characters and their relationship.  And last but not least, the Lannister brothers continue to steal every scene they're in.  They're perfect."
1,3,Lord Snow,"i really liked the look on jaime's face when he tell stark that he felt he was doing justice's work by killing the mad king and starks like ""whatever you need to tell yourself at night""
 "
1,3,Lord Snow,"was the pronunciation of 'catelyn' a shock to anyone else?

I just finished the third book and have been reading it like as though it was the real people name Caitlyn this whole time"
1,3,Lord Snow,"What i found weird, was that Daenerys was not the one who decided her brother should walk instead of ride. Instead one of Drogos Bloodriders decided that for her :/"
1,3,Lord Snow,"Old Nan gives us a Dunk & Egg call-out (sort of)! After, of course, her [Book Spoiler](/b ""possibly portentous comment about crows? (including those of the three-eyed variety?) Didn't remember that specific line from the books"")"
1,3,Lord Snow,"i think that Cersei really showed her true colors, ""when you are king the truth will be what you make it"""
1,3,Lord Snow,I'm looking forward to the development of Arya she is one of my favorite characters and the show is doing its justice!
1,3,Lord Snow,"i was thinking after the episode

[Book Spoiler](/b ""Y U NO TELL YOUR BROTHER TO WALK"")

and maybe I'm being too critical, but I would like to see them add at least a bit more phrases from the books that they say...just general ones nothing specific (but perhaps they editing it cause it comes out too long)"
1,3,Lord Snow,"I only have one complaint about this episode: [Book Spoiler](/b ""Jaime comes across a lot more likable than I remember from the first book, also when he's recounting killing the king he delivered that line a little tooo well, almost like he regrets ruining his honor but knew it had to be done"")
"
1,3,Lord Snow,"Uhm... I can't check the books right now, but as far as I remember, when Cersei and Jaime know about Bran's murder attempt,[TV Spoiler](/s "" they discuss about who did it and later in the books we discover that it was Joffrey's plan, trying to impress them after hearing something like Bran would be better dead than in coma, and in this episode Jaime plainly declares itself guilty."")

Still it's been a great episode, as usual!"
1,3,Lord Snow,I just finished watching this episode and I must say I loved every scene; they really did a good job at casting. The closing scene with Arya was the perfect ending.
1,3,Lord Snow,The acting on this show is seriously off the charts good. As well as the casting. Its so wonderful to watch this come to life.
1,3,Lord Snow,"Ned to Arya ""When winter comes, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives."" This should have been there."
1,3,Lord Snow,[deleted]
1,3,Lord Snow,"I love how they're hammering in the [Book Spoiler](/b ""Arya is a fucking murderous psycho"") thing this early in."
1,3,Lord Snow,"Maybe my memory is slipping, but was Yoren always that silly in the books? If I remember correctly, he was a lot more serious. "
1,3,Lord Snow,"Was anyone else annoyed how the previews have Joffrey saying ""Seize Winterfell""?  He does say it in the episode, but in a completely different context.  I know previews do that a lot but this time it was particularly deceiving."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","I'm liking Littlefinger a lot. Maybe it's just the actor (also liked him as Carcetti), but his scenes are always interesting, and I'm guessing that he's scheming something (I haven't read the books). However, I thought his explanation of the Hound's backstory was really poorly timed. We have this guy dying on the ground and then all of a sudden we get two minutes of character exposition.

Ned's investigation was the most interesting arc of this episode. We learn about Robert's bastard (and his cool helmet), get to see some more of King's Landing, and some more backstory with Jaime.

Sam looks promising. They could not have made him more pathetic (though still likeable), so I'm hoping we see him transform for the better as the show goes on. But I have a feeling he might just die abruptly north of the wall."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","[TV Spoiler](/s ""The only thing the bathtub scene taught me was that Viserys can't get hard unless he's talking about dragons"")"
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","The bastard is Chris from Skins. One of my favorite actors. The casting in this show is impeccable. Every episode characters like Jaime, Tyrion, and Daenerys just amaze me."

Win.

Also, Doreah is hot. "
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","While most people think that the bath tub scene was long and unnecessary, I thought that it-and quite a few other scenes in the episode-were good ways to address the Targaryens. They've only dropped hints here and there about what happened to them in the past, but in this episode you learned a bit more about who they are, who's great, who's not, and why they're called the dragons.

Maybe I'm not phrasing it right, but I think it was a good way to toss information in to those who haven't read the books."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","This was a plot building episode. After 3 episodes, they needed to fill in the gaps for a lot of the audience not familiar with the source material. They also built bridges for the plot to cross over later. Down time with heavy dialog scenes will allow for faster more action packed scenes down the road. "
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","I really enjoyed this episode.

I thought the scene at the inn was very well done, as was Daenerys's fight with Viserys.

I thought Viserys's scene with Doreah(?) was too long and unnecessary.

It was a very dialogue-filled episode, but I thought all of it really helped the plot, and it was nice that it seemed the next episode would be a bit more action-packed"
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things",I really liked the last scene (in the inn). It basically showed us how feudalism works. ^^
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things",[deleted]
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","the biggest thing is definitely the lackluster tournament.  It did not seem like the sort of thing one would spend 100k galleons on, hopefully we'll get more of it next week, but it should all have been in one episode.  I did like seeing Littlefinger cozying up to Sansa though.  I thought he gave off just the right amount of creepiness.  And while it kills the fanboy inside of me to say it, it probably makes sense to jettison the hound/Sansa arc.  It's not needed [Book Spoiler](/b ""to make the hound/arya arc work"") and would take up a lot of screen time that could be better spent on things that are more central to the plot.

Pacing was also still an issue, but less of one than it has been in the previous two episodes.  Unlike the LOTR movies, the show definitely seems stronger when it isn't cribbing scenes straight from the books.  All of the best scenes from this week(Tyrion/Theon, Jaime/Jorey) were not from the books, and I think it definitely shows.  I hope that, as time goes on, the writers will wean themselves off of transcribing the books verbatim and learn to use the events in the book as more of an outline.

Last big thing is the crow, which I loved.  Like Littlefinger, it was super creepy.  Bran's crow dream is awesome, but having a giant dream sequence would fly in the face of the gritty, realistic mood they're going for.  They're avoiding it for the same reason they aren't having flashbacks.  Plus the dreams give Bran more of an arc for season 1.

Little things.  Loved the Jorey/Jaime scene.  Did you catch the way Nikki COMPLETELY changed his attitude once Jorey got him talking about fighting, then completely changed it back once Jorey mentioned Ned?  Just fantastic acting.  I also liked the scene, but it felt out of place.  It should have been 2 episodes earlier.  Dany standing up to Viserys also felt a little out of place.  It should have been the penultimate scene, and Mormont should have been in the background taking Dany's side over her brother's.  Lastly, I liked Sam.  Some people are saying he looked dumb, but I didn't get that impression.  Depressed?  Resigned?  Sure, but you would be too if you were in his situation.  And Alister Thorne's speech was fantastic."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","It got through a lot less than I thought it would, but it was still quite a packed episode. A lot of backstory was expanded upon once again.

(Book 1 Spoiler)[Book Spoiler](/b ""I thought the part where Jory talked to Jaime was actually a cool scene. Not quite for what happened there, but for when Jory dies when Jaime's guards attack Ned and his group. I'm sure they'll incorporate it somehow."")

(Book 1 Spoiler)[Book Spoiler](/b ""The scene with Littlefinger and Sansa has left me wondering something. Didn't The Hound tell Sansa the story when he was taking her back at night? I could be wrong, but I think it would have a been a cool scene."")

And Dany stood up to Viserys! [TV Spoiler](/s ""Though I didn't like that scene with him in the bathtub. Yeah it takes out the bit where either Ned or Arya see the skulls, which I guess helps budget wise, but I would have liked to have seen them. Anyway, I didn't like that scene cause he didn't seem quite crazy enough. Yeah a bit at the end, but a bit too cutesy for my tastes."")

I almost made a complete ass of myself. Sorry if anyone saw it before I deleted and re-posted."

1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things",">Well I guess everyone complaining about there not being enough Ghost got a wake up call!

Now we need him more, walking beside Jon at all times. It's the first time we've seen ghost since episode one as a puppy (I know he was at the edge of the screen in episode two during the camp scene...but, he wasn't really in the scene). 

Considering how important ghost is to Jon's character, I'm surprised we don't see more of him. 


Also the crow was creepy as hell. Just saying."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","Introduced 2 of my favourite characters - Hodor and Sam the Slayer. Also, i'd completely forgotten about that scene in which Catelyn takes Tyrion captive, loved it. Strong episode."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","There are a couple of things that bugged me:

1 ) Ghost made sounds.  I made a little frown when I heard him growl. :(  

2) The scene with Tyrion and Robb.  Wasn't feeling it.  Something about the pace, it felt rushed.  I know it's not gonna be a popular opinion but I think it's Tyrion's actor who dropped the ball on it.  Which is sad because right after he knocked it out of the ballpark with Theon.

"
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","Lots of my thoughts can be explained in other posts. The Tourney being a huge kick in the nuts being my main point. But on a lighter note...I was irritated that they called Gregor ""The Mountain""...and left off ""That Rides"". The Mountain by itself isn't anything we haven't heard before, it was always the full name that won my awe and hooked my attention. But guess we gotta save every second to fit anything and everything we can (bathtub scene being the exception apparently) "
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","One of my favourite episodes so far, in terms of pacing, drama and dialogue. The long-ass bath sequence was so fucking unnecessary though.

Samwell was well casted though"
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","Non-book-reader here. Who exactly was Eddard Stark trying to do research on? His father, the Mad King?"
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","This was probably my least favorite episode.

Every scene that did not amount to two characters having a dialog was great. But more than half the episode was nothing but that. I kept thinking, ""They're really front-loading the exposition this time around, they must have something big they're setting us up for."" 

Instead it never came, or not until the last 3 minutes.

The only way this episode is redeemable is if it was intended as a big setup for a payoff *next* week. 

I also note that this is the first episode not written by D&D-- I imagine that has something to do with it. They're back next week, and (IIRC) every episode this season except for 8, which is written by GRRM, and so should be awesome."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","SAM! Sam is perfect! And the Ned/Littlefinger scene was excellent: ""Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you got off your horse"", as was the Jaime/Jory scene.

However, although good, I don't feel this episode measured up to the previous three. Obviously there's a lot of backstory and plot that they have to fill in, but without the books' internal monologues, extended dialogue got a little tiresome.

I would have shortened or cut the scene with Ser Alliser on cannabalism and shortened (but not cut) the scene with Viserys in the bath, in favour of one or two more jousting tilts. I'm sure we will have more tourney next week [(Robert trying to enter the melee, and the jousting finals)](/spoiler) but I think we should definitely have at least seen two more this week. Maybe [Lothor vs Jory, Selmy vs unnamed knight, possibly even Jaime vs Selmy or Beric vs Chequered Cloak.](/spoiler)"
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","So idiotic for a queen to think that the dwarf was the one behind the attempted murder oh her son, just because his knife was left behind lmao. 

Like. Why on earth would he ever give an assassin his own knife, which can easily be traced back to him, to assassinate someone? Bruh, he could found thousands of other swords if he wanted to lol. 

It's so obvious that he is being framed by someone. 

Well atleast this what i think. I have only watched up to this episode so far. And if it was actually him giving the assassin his knife. Then him being an educated person would be the most disappointing thing."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things",[deleted]
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","Well, one of the first episodes where they really had to insert a lot of non-book material to set things up. Some parts I liked, some I did not. Especially the Littlefinger-Sansa dialogue. I really dont see why it was done this way. Sam's casting just feels a bit off. 

Also, this is King's Landing and the tournament attracted a huge number of people in the book, couldn't they get more extras (or some cool cgi)!!! It looked like hardly 2-300 people showed up for the tournament. The scale of the show is kinda bothering me, I was expecting it be a bit more grand, guess HBO was playing it safe with the first season and did not want to spend money. "
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","Weirdly enough, as I barely remember the hand's tourney from the book (it was 3 years ago when I read it) the only thing I really had issue with in this episode...well the Mountain seemed a bit small. I mean sure there's only so much that can be done given the raw scale of Gregor Clegane. 

I mean fuck 400 pounds of muscle, nearly 8 feet tall, and armor that inspires thoughts of a walking dreadnaught? And characterization that brings to mind thoughts of a nameless faceless horror? I've got high hopes though."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","I thought this was the worst episode so far. I'll forgive the [Book Spoiler](/b ""littlefinger/alayne err...sansa scene if we get the hound part the second day."") There better be more of the tourney. I was pretty disappointed though about how lame it looked.

I thought the viserys bathtub scene was a waste of screen time.

They did though seem to drop a lot of bread crumbs for those who read all the books so far. [Book Spoiler](/b ""jon obviously has a thing for red heads"")

Just too many little deviations from the book this time and a lot of compression. They really need more eps in the second season."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","Overall, I feel like if hbo cut back on the (sex and other) scenes that werent really in the book, they would have more room for stuff and dialog that happened in the book but had to be cut or compressed. I guess this episode somewhat frustrated me. The tourney was just for the sole purpose of littlefinger giving backstory on the cleganes. The tourney had none of the glamor from the book (robert loving it, sansa being enchanted with it, Knight of Flowers, Thoros, etc.) and I thought the mountain that rides wasnt as unbelievably huge as the books lead you to imagine. [TV Spoiler](/s""Also, i thought the hound was the one who told sansa the story when he was drunk as hell and escorted her back to her room. I really like the actor for Samwell Tarly, he could be a bit more of a quiet puny overly educated cultured prissy whiner but whatev. The almost complete lack of ghost is disappointing, the direwolfs presence was noted constantly in the book. could they have edited his growls out? I remember Ghost being pretty silent.....like a ghost. I found Thornes speech a little boring. The confrontations between Dany and Viserys seem to be a bit lacking in intensity. I feel like they could have done a better job at showing Viserys to be an awful person more (by showing more of his interactions with Dany) than a lame bathtub scene with a whore. Maybe they could have delivered the backstory on the Targaryens with some dialog with Ned and Arya walking around looking at the gigantic dragon skulls?"") HBO seems to be playing it safe with a lower budget for certain things (tourney, etc) and trying to boost ratings with plenty of sex and stuff. "
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things",The dwarf got owned!
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things",I sincerely hope that's not all we see of the Hand's Tourney.  If the next episode just references it as a thing of the past I will be very disappointed.  There were a lot of important things that happened at that Tournament.
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","I really think they blew it with Viserys.  They should have shown him saying 'you've awoken the dragon"" and beating Daenerys in the first episode to establish his control and abuse of her.  Now when he says ""you've awoken the dragon, you just yawn.

Visery's scene with the whore was WAY too long and unnecessary.  Do we really need to know about dragon skulls?

Sam is portrayed as TOO much a pussy.  He gives up way too easy when a practice sword is swung his way.

Great scene with Ghost, glad to see him back in the show.

Alliser Thorne is perfect, a real asshole.

I don't have the book handy, but I don't recall Tyrion being so obvious and blatant about what Bran remembers.  I mean, really, the first thing you say when you see him is ""Do you remember anything?"" is pretty damming.  Tyrion is way too subtle for that.

[Book Spoiler](/b ""Since Littlefinger tells the story of the Hound's scar, that means Sandor won't and he won't tell Sansa that Gregor killed Ser Hugh on purpose"").  I was disappointed that that fact wasn't mentioned by Littlefinger in the episode, this is the first indication that Gregor is a sociopath. [Book Spoiler](/b ""Now that I think about it, Ser Hugh was Jon Arryn's squire, promoted to knight.  Could Gregor have been instructed to kill him?  The tourney does happen after Ned is seen visiting the blacksmith."")."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","Good episode, though I hope the next one brings more action and less talking."
1,4,"Cripples, Bastards, & Broken Things","It warn't great. The first half didn't seem well directed. A lot of first-takes, actors just rattling off lines, etc.

A few specific criticisms:

Sammy-T: Terrible. Poorly cast and portrayed, in my opinion. Oh well.

The Hound: Robbed! (by Littlefinger of course) I hate to sound like some kind of super-fan who screams every time something from the book is altered, but we missed out big-time on the scene between him and Sansa. [Book Spoiler](/b ""Him getting drunk and telling her the story himself which NO ONE's supposed to know, then threatening to kill her if she repeats it was choice GRRM."") It really started him down the path of being one of the most interesting characters in the series, not to mention fleshed out the events of the second day of the tourney. Too bad.

Alliser Thorne: Meh. He's just not loathsome enough. I mean, sure he's a douche, but he comes across as just another in a string of what-do-you-know-about-winter-sonny-boy characters.

Viserys: Seems they've taken him slightly overboard. It's the same thing over and over. Honestly, the Dany thread is going to have to go into filler mode soon. Be nice if we had a breather from it for at least an episode, to save up for the awesome things to come.

The good: The scene at the crossroads inn was great, hooray finally a visit from ghost, and a never-ending, lance-through-the-neck, choke-on-a-river-of-blood death scene which will be fodder for endless memes and parodies!

TL,DR (TL): I loved the first three; #4 not so much. Now let's get back to being good."

[Book Spoiler](/b ""This Tourney has to be a huge contrast to the small wimpy tournament for Joffrey later on. They will have to work hard to make something even less exciting."")"
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"The best scene had to be Catelyn looking sideways at Tyrion while Lysa was ranting and raving!  You can tell she is thinking ""oh fuck, this wasn't a good idea, was it?"".

That had me laughing!"
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"As a non-reader, I did not expect Jory to be killed by Jaime.. like that. I was starting to like Jory, and now I know why Jaime is such a giant douche. "
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,They did the breast feeding. I did not expect the breast feeding.
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,*Loved* Robert & Cersei - holding it all together.
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,No love for Tyrion beating the hell out of a man with a shield? 
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,the eyrie was not how i imagined it :/ thought it would be higher up with tons of snow but it still was pretty sweet set design. and lady starks sister is just how i imagined her crazy widow breastfeeding her son.
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"The shit has officially hit the fan. And it's all chaos from here on out. I always said the whole saga really began with Cat taking Tyrion in the Inn. Everything afterwards was just like..... well, *you know* and they did a great job illustrating just **that** in this episode.

What I also found interesting was  no Dothraki to speak of. No Jon Snow. I like that. It was almost like reading one of the chapters.

 Thank you, thank you writers for making this real, you are doing such great jobs! This episode was just fucking amazing. It just gets better from here on out guys.

BTW, This is my favorite subreddit."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,Non-book reader here. HOLY FUCK. My head is still spinning from all of the crazy that just happened. Best episode so far.
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"I'm loving that you get a sense that Robert is *not* a complete idiot-- he can't run a kingdom but he's the only one who has the Dothraki problem pegged. He's a general, a tactician and a brilliant warrior. He's just not a good king."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"The shits hitting the fan now... For all the non-book folks, if you thought tonight was good next week will be epic.  Every episode from here on out should be a wild ride.  

And again, Arya <3 - her acting of Arya is sooo perfect.  The feistiness and everything.  

Also the Varys/Littlefinger banter in front of the throne was really great.   "
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"Did any other book readers love the scene with Loras holding up Sandor's hand, while Sansa stands and claps? [Book Spoiler](/b ""She's enraptured with Loras at the moment, but knowing how her relationship with the Hound develops gives the scene a bit of significance. I'm not implying anything romantic, though it could be interpreted that way. It's just clear that he genuinely wants to protect her, whereas most of the actual knights in the story are indifferent about caring for the weak. He's her real champion."")"
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"An excellent episode, probably the best yet, though last week's was also quite good.  Still disappointed about the tournament.  They should have made it a big single episode and worked the the palace intrigue around it.  I was actually quite glad not to see the Wall or the Dothraki Sea for an episode.  Not that I don't like those parts, but it's good so see that the writers think it's ok to spend a week focusing on just one part of the story without cutting to the others.  My biggest complain would be the larger sense of time.  The whole series feels like it's taken place in a month, tops.  If they do't work out how to generate a sense of time, I think the later episodes and seasons are going to feel very weird.

Little things.  Loved Loras, and the scene with Loras and Renly, but ask the mirror and Lancel is still the fairest of them all.  Cersi and Robert's scene was a lot of blatant exposition, but I definitely think they did it well and pulled it off.  The Varys/Little finger duel was also a nice way to drive home that they are the people who really matter in KL.  Also, Arya's scene with the guards is utterly perfect.  Massie Williams is definitely my favorite actress in the show."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,That was the craziest hour of television I have ever seen in my life.
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"was not expecting theon greyjoy's full frontal, but i'm glad they're bringing up his issues early on and letting us know his history since he's important later. "

1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,Episode 5: Nailed it! Pure awesome. Wouldn't change a thing.

Theon: Famed for their skills as archery, navigation, and lovemaking.
Luwin: ...and failed rebellions."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"What I really liked about this episode was that it was a nice mix of crazy action and political intrigue and maneuvering. The episode was sort of an amalgamation of everything that the ""game of thrones"" is about. 

At least three big fights, several big important conversations, and lots of subtle laying of groundwork for later events - [Book Spoiler](/b ""even little things like Yoren meeting Arya, and thinking she's a boy. So minor but it will pay off so much later on"")."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"My friend and his girlfriend, who haven't read the books, started asking me questions tonight about lineages. I love watching this with people who don't know what to expect. I thought we'd see more of the Eyrie tonight, but I suppose that storyline is a bit too long to shoehorn in with the events we saw in King's Landing.

I was mildly disappointed with the appearance of the Eyrie but it was still impressive enough that my friend's girlfriend said, ""Oh my god"", when they showed Tyrion's cell. Not at all like I imagined, but they seem to have captured the character of it."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"Holy shit, the fight between Ned and Jaime was fucking awesome. The tension of that scene was so palpable that it could be cut with a knife

Also, the scene between Loras and Renly was...unexpected. I don't recall coming across that while reading the first book, but it does explain why [Book Spoiler](/b ""Loras kills a bunch of guys when Renly is mysteriously killed in COK, and why they hint how Margaerey (spelling?) will die a maiden despite being married to Renly."")"
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"And it is just me, or does Jaime always have the fucking coolest wardrobe in the Seven Kingdoms?"

1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"Holy cow, they sure hit us over the head with the Renly/Loras connection didn't they?

I thought ""the look"" at the tournament was enough of a hint, but to see Loras ""attend"" to Renly, especially with the ""you really like me like this?"" line sure made it obvious but did they need the slurping sounds?  I just thought oh man, even the thickest of viewers will get it!"
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"I was confused by the revelation that Jorah Mormont was betraying Dany already. I thought that was only revealed later? Maybe that's another thing I missed and I need to stop reading so quickly.

1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"So, did we have our first mention of Stannis tonight?  Because I don't remember him being mentioned at all before."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"I thought this was an amazing episode, and it really picked up from the ""calm before the storm"" of last week's. Tonight was the perfect balance, going back and forth from drama to action to exposition to action etc."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"Dammit I'm still hungry, 1 hour just isn't enough. Why did I have to learn about this series while it's still airing?

Tempted to start into the books.



"
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"What a great episode! I thought a couple of the conversation scenes felt long, but overall I loved this episode!"
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"I do have to admit. I dont understand the little thing that just happened between Varys and Littlefinger..... at that beginning... well fuck it, and at the end. WTF just happened?"
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"The Robert/Cersei banter was my favorite part of the episode. [TV Spoiler](/s ""Jory dying"") was my least."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"I've a random comment.  A the end of the episode, it states:

In memory of
Caroline Lois Benoist

A quick google search shows that she apparently died of swine flu and was part of a group of animal trainers.

Here's to you, Caroline."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"Non-reader here; Oh, and obviously this is full of episode spoilers.

Okay, I really don't like Cat now. In fact, I don't like the whole plot arc of her kidnapping Tyrion. They just happen to meet at an inn between King's Landing and the Wall, Cat happens to have a dozen friends and no one that would defend one of the most powerful families in the kingdom. Oh, and then all those random people decide ""yeah, sure, I'll go on an long, dangerous journey to the Eyrie. I mean, I was doing other stuff, but that sounds cool..."" 

And I know the reason she went to the Eyrie was to avoid being chased to Winterfell by the Lannisters, but doesn't she realize that kidnapping him to some unknown location would make them just as pissed? She doesn't think anything through, and the whole arc seems contrived to have Cat & Tyrion end up at the Eyrie. Weakest arc so far.

With that said... this was an absolutely awesome episode. By far more action than any other episode, a really intense finale (and dammit, I *really* hate Jaime now, Jory was the man), and a lot of plotting. I'm so happy I'll be able to watch the next two episodes in a row, though the 2 week dry period will suck.

Based on the next episode preview, I'm pretty sure Viserys is going to get killed. He's just so insolent and demanding of the Dothraki, I don't think they're going to put up with him. It's really been a long time coming."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,Finished watching it only 20 minutes ago. I need to watch it a second time now. That's how good that episode was.
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,lol wasn't really ready to see little arryn on lysa
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,WHAT AN EPISODE!!! I'M GONNA CONTINUE READING NOW!!!! (at the part in the book where the Imp was just taken prisoner)
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,Can someone give me a recap of Varys and his Dothraki scheming?
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"I love the girl which they casted for the role of Arrya more and more with every new episode. She reminds me of a little Marion Cotillard, talent and look wise."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"Enjoyed the episode, but was disappointed that they cut short Littlefingers ""Whores are a better investment than ships"" speech.

In the book, he says exactly what was onscreen, but then goes on to add [Book Spoiler](/b ""And if they're boarded by pirates, why, the pirates pay good coin like every other man""). Awesome."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"One thought that popped into my head during this episode is that they have a male child actor sucking on a woman's tit.  Unless it was a fake boob, which is definitely possible, and probably given statutory rape laws in this country."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,Why are they trying to make Cersei likeable?
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,[deleted]
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,I just noticed something else. It seems that Sansa has somewhat reconciled her anger with her father.
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"This episode was much better than last-weeks. I loved the new scenes which really helped to drive the TV show along. The sense of scale is still really wrong, but this week they made it work for a TV-show. 

Even though the fight scene played out completely different than in the book I liked it. They wanted to end on a high-note and made everything a bit more actiony. "
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"So, the throne room confrontation between Varys and Littlefinger...  I thought it came off as way too aggressive and confrontational.  I thought one of the beauties of the book was the subtle way that you could tell they were in conflict, but they were always very polite with each other."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"Fantastic episode, things are heating up now.

I particularly can't wait to see the next episode 'The Golden Crown', particularly the scene which the title refers to."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"Jory should have said to Arya in this episode while they were walking away from Ned Stark and talking about him defending her father...  [Book Spoiler](/b ""One of us Northerners could kill ten of them (he could have said the the lions but saying ""them"" would have been just as good.) ."")"
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"The Eyrie... it's annoying me that they keep pronouncing it ""eerie.""  If the castle is named after an [Eagle's nest](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eyrie), which would make sense since it is ""built in a high inaccessible place"" I always thought it should be pronounced ""airy.""

I see now that both pronunciations are correct, but I really think that ""airy"" is the more commonly used/accepted version."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"House Martell. You should be happy.

Hint: The stick and the map."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,Somebody needs to post the episode like they do in r/doctorwho!
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,So how do we get on the list for House Tags? I would like to be a Martell myself.
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,i would have liked to have seen cersi goading robert into jousting.  if they arent going to do the melee they can do that at least.
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"Did anyone notice that the Eyrie knight (Ser Corbray, I think) had a Welsh accent? 

The only other Vale people who spoke were  Lysa and Robin speak, and Lysa would have a Tully accent that she would have passed on to her son.

I hope everyone else at the Eyrie speaks with a Welsh twang. I never thought of the Vale as being the Wales of Westeros before now, but it makes sense. :)"
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,And the slurping sound was....?
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,How do you pronounce Jhiqui and Irri?
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,Non-book folk here (I'm currently listening to the audio book and have somehow managed to basically keep pace with the show which is pretty neat) and I think she's in my top 3 favorite characters. Best moment in the episode for me was when she is talking with her dad about running off and she says she was chasing a cat. The way she hesitated and knew that what she was about to say sounded just stupidly silly was perfect!
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"(Non-Book reader (currently in the process of reading it)) To be fair, that very slight eye flicker at the tournament didn't tell me anything except that they knew each other. I thought he was signalling for him to just get a move on. There was embarrassment and a secrecy to it, but I wouldn't have assumed they were together from that alone.  It did become painfully obvious and tactfully so when Littlefinger said ""when will you be ""having"" *your* friend?"" Well, that and the fact that he has the classic anime effeminate dandy thing going on. That helped too."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"Heart was left racing and i was shaking by the end.

Some of the best TV I have seen."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"Tyrion's mental thoughts: ""Dead? Nope. Dead? No. Dead? Hmm, not yet. Dead? Still no. Dead? Not quite. Dead? Well, maybe. Dead? Ya. Dead? Definitely."""
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,Loved the part where the Hound and Mountain finish their fight at the King's command.
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"I wanted to see Loras's mare dance.

In the scene in the book Gregor is riding a spirited stallion, and Loras rides a mare in heat.  Gregor loses because his horse throws him, not because he's poor with a lance, thus his horse butchery.  The scene in the show left a lot out, and tried to shove it back in with forced exposition.

Also, as if to drive home the point about how pretty Loras is, his mare is trained to prance sideways on command.  That would've been cool."
1,5,The Wolf and the Lion,"The action was amazing, but the long exposition completely sapped the energy out of the episode. It was arduous, and in a lot of cases unnecessary. That whole scene with Cersei and Robert didn't need to be there at all."

I really like the guy who played Mord - not exactly as I pictured, but did an excellent job with his scenes, and played off Dinklage very well.

Bronn is crazy awesome, as befits the character.

Great episode, probably my favorite one so far."
1,6,A Golden Crown,"that hunt scene was the most dissapointing thing so far, i mean wtf was that? four guys tromping around in a forest? they didn't even have horses! but other than that it was fucking fantastic, the crown scene was spot on!"
1,6,A Golden Crown,So that's where the episode gets its name.
1,6,A Golden Crown,"Damn... the crown scene was absolutely chillingly horrifying. Not saying that there wasn't some sense of satisfaction, but that scream + that one staring eye."
1,6,A Golden Crown,"""Bronny, I feel like this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"""
1,6,A Golden Crown,"Sansa hasn't bothered me until this episode. I'm sorry, but Sansa Stark would never be that rude to her Septa. It's too unladylike. It just seemed like she threw out one rude remark after another in that scene, and it bothered me."
1,6,A Golden Crown,"Most shows - average shows - would go out of there way to explain how, and in great expository detail, how a heavily armored knight fighting a nimble, lightly armored man would soon tire and could be bested. 

Not this show. 

Not only do they use the camera work to let that information be told simply and all visually, the Arya scenes learning to ""dance"" lightly also play so well into giving us, the audience, all the information we need to be completely invested and immersed in this world. I really feel like this is a living, breathing world. 

This show is a feat like none other. Every week it surpasses the week before and it is now absolutely the most bad-ass show I have ever watched - it's like getting to watch an entire series based around the premise of Mal from Firefly kicking someone into a spaceship engine over and over again. 

I've told everyone I know to watch this show - begged them to watch it - and the few who have put up with me and taken my advice are now fans too. I'm so glad the people who make this show haven't made me look like a fool. "
1,6,A Golden Crown,dances with wolves had a heart eating scene but game of thrones just Dethroned that one if you know what i mean
1,6,A Golden Crown,Did Ned go totally batshit in the books too? I remember him calling for the execution of Gregor but nothing about him summoning Tywin to court.
1,6,A Golden Crown,Bronn reminds me of Indiana Jones a bit. Badass. Viserys had it coming. And I loved Arya's face when Sansa kept talking about Joffrey.

1,6,A Golden Crown,the king makes a slap heard round the internets!!
1,6,A Golden Crown,"Great to be able to put a face to Beric Dondarrion. It'll be awesome to see the shenanigans he gets himself up to in later seasons. However I would have liked to at least see the lightning bolt sigil, or some sort of signal that this is an interesting character, instead of just a solemn-faced Lord who happened to be in the back of the room at the right time.

But all in due time, I guess."
1,6,A Golden Crown,"I'm starting to miss the Wall. Two episodes without Jon? At this rate they'll end up combining a bunch of his chapters... which I suppose makes sense/is necessary. That was my only spot of bother with the episode, otherwise: perfect."
1,6,A Golden Crown,I've been looking forward to that bit with Viserys since the show started. They did it even better than I imagined!
1,6,A Golden Crown,"anyone else feel like they are making some characters more sympathetic than they were in the books? specifically cersei and viserys (who was one of the characters it really was a shame to see go cause i just loved the way they portrayed him) i just felt when he was ""crowned"" that i actually felt sorry for him for a bit. 
"
1,6,A Golden Crown,"Can I ask a couple of questions? I haven't read the books, so I'm wondering if this is explained more fully there, or maybe it was explained in the show and I just missed it.

Why did Lady Catelyn take Tyrion Lannister to The Eyrie for judgement? Was it because they were in her sister's jurisdiction, or do a lot of cases get taken to The Eyrie for trial?

Also, did Lady Catelyn know that the two ways Tyrion could be judged were by a child or by sword fight? Or did she think her sister would be the judge (still not cool as her sister is biased against the Lannisters)? If she knew and considered that justice it doesn't seem very noble, but maybe I'm just imposing my own view of justice on the Seven Kingdoms.

Thanks!

1,6,A Golden Crown,"Wait so, you can watch episode 7 on HBO GO? I have no idea what my direct tv account info is. Anyone wanna throw Episode 7 on baconbits or TPB?"
1,6,A Golden Crown,"I don't feel this episode was nearly as strong as the last two.  A lot happened, but somehow it felt like nothing was really happening.  An odd reversal though, this week the strongest scenes were straight from the books (the coronation, eating the heart, Cersi hitting Robert), while the weakest was definitely the hunting party.  The Direwolves are still way too absent, and it's a shame to see Harry Lloyd go, but I don't feel I have much to say about this episode.  Mostly, it was just more of the same, which is a good thing. "
1,6,A Golden Crown,"Do the seasons correspond with the book?
For example, season 1 = book 1, season 2 = book 2 etc..."
1,6,A Golden Crown,"To discuss something different - I loved Dondarrion!

Ned tells him to kill bring justice to The Mountain, something even Robert would not have dared to do:

*manly nod of approval*

""This Hand guy is AWESOME. Almost as awesome as [Book Spoiler](/b""I'm in book 2"")"""

1,6,A Golden Crown,"Honestly, if Cersei was getting raped by twenty guys in an alley somewhere and screamed for help I'd probably keep walking once I saw her face."

Winter is coming, the white walkers are awake again, the Dothraki are going to cross the sea while the Starks and the Lannisters are too busy fighting each other and they might go to war. I'm so fucking excited to see what happens!"
1,7,You Win or You Die,"I'm absolutely adoring Tywin Lannister right now.

I know this probably makes me sound like some kind of serial killer, but there is something massively attractive about watching someone as powerful as the Lord of Casterly Rock putting Jaime Lannister in his place while methodically gutting and cleaning his latest kill.

Must be the cave woman in me :p

All that aside, I cannot wait to see more of Tywin, he's so close to how I actually imagined him!"
1,7,You Win or You Die,I still can't believe that Ned trusted Littlefinger.
1,7,You Win or You Die,too bad about no Tyrion in this one.  At least we got to see the wall again.  this happens when you have 5 different locations going.
1,7,You Win or You Die,Drogo's speech made me want to join him in invading Westeros.
1,7,You Win or You Die,"Tywin is instantly my new favorite character (well, based on what we've seen on the show alone, so far, anyway.  Having read the books, I know I'll like some other characters better eventually).  That opening scene with him and Jaime was the best scene of the show so far."
1,7,You Win or You Die,"> Ros: I do believe my lord is in love 

>Littlefinger: For many years, most of my life really. Play with her ass.

Little known fact: Littlefinger studied in Oldtown long enough to earn his gold dragon necklace. 

Petyr Baelish - Maester Pimp
"
1,7,You Win or You Die,I wonder how long the assassin lasted.  
1,7,You Win or You Die,"Ned firmly adheres to honour in a world (much like ours) where honour plays no part in reality.

Its a pity. Had he done as Littlefinger advised, or at least handed things over to Renly well... we can but see how things play out. At every turn he makes the wrong decision. It was very unwise to underestimate Cersei, Very unwise to trust Littlefinger/Spider and man, he's going to get fucked...

WHY on earth did he take the blame for tyrion's capture? "
1,7,You Win or You Die,"finally, a wolf......"
1,7,You Win or You Die,"Ahhh Littlefinger! Why!? I liked you so much, I can't look at you in the same way now..."
1,7,You Win or You Die,[deleted]
1,7,You Win or You Die,"I liked how they had Osha making brooms, and even had one set up already: http://i.imgur.com/RBu52.png 

I don't know if it was meant to be a nod to Harry Potter and her role as Tonks, but I like to think so."
1,7,You Win or You Die,"I didn't think about it reading the book, but the show for some reason gave me the idea: Was the assassin put in place by Jorah himself? Seems obvious now as he gets his pardon, looks at the princess, then decides to approach. So anybody else see this that didn't see it in the book?"
1,7,You Win or You Die,Anyone else get too distracted by the visual images of both the gutted deer and the two prostitutes to pay attention to the words that Tywin and Littlefinger were saying? 
1,7,You Win or You Die,"why did they make ghost bark? how entirely unnecessary. do they really have such little respect for the audience that they think we're going to say ""he didn't bark and therefore is not a real dog""?"
1,7,You Win or You Die,"Funny thing: In the book, I misunderstood what happened. I thought Littlefinger pulled out the dagger and sliced Ned's throat, killing him. So I'm reading the next few chapters with the thought in my head 'Man, is the shit about to hit the fan'.  Of course it later became obvious he wasn't killed by Littlefinger, just captured."
1,7,You Win or You Die,"Another exposition scene in a whorehouse, and the most ~~awesome~~ explicit one to date. Who's keeping track? Is that at least one in every episode now?"
1,7,You Win or You Die,"[Book Spoiler](/b ""Surprised not to see any discussion of Sansa's betrayal ... or lack thereof in the show.  In the book she tips off Cersei to Ned's plans to get Arya and Sansa out of town.  I also thought that was a pretty key to her character."")"
1,7,You Win or You Die,"[Book Spoiler](/b ""Did they skip Sansa's betrayal when she tells Cersei her father's plan? I think that betrayal and the guilt over it would be a major part of the Sansa character."")"
1,8,The Pointy End,"Who the fuck was that!?  Oh yeah, Rickon, the hidden Stark."
1,8,The Pointy End,"So many great ""small"" moments this episode.

When Robb commanded the ravens be sent to all the banner men and first we get a shot of them flying past the window and then it cuts to a wide shot of Winterfell with all those ravens screaming skyward is quite possibly the coolest damn thing I could imagine. Such a simple shot, but it just captures the enormity of what is about to happen.

And Robb really came into his own this episode. Up till now he's just been kind of there but now we get to see what the casting people saw in him. Yeah, he's a green kid, but he's got the best quality of both his parents and Richard Madden (the actor) really got a chance to shine. 

I also love they kept that tiny moment where when Cat first sees Robb in the tent she does not hug him in front of the other lords but addressed him as a grown man and a true leader. That was one of my favorite moments in the book and I am SO glad they took the time to have that momentary beat in an episode with so much happening. 

I guess the other ""small"" moment was not so small, however. Hodor. "
1,8,The Pointy End,"SYRIO FOREL

FUCK YEAH"
1,8,The Pointy End,"""Even now I can cut through the 5 of you like carving a cake"""
1,8,The Pointy End,Drogo is a boss
1,8,The Pointy End,GREATJON!!!
1,8,The Pointy End,"I was really hoping they had the quote from the Syrio scene from the book.

""You are quick for a dancing master...""

""You are slow for a knight. ...""

Scene was still awesome"
1,8,The Pointy End,I *like* living!
1,8,The Pointy End,"Best episode yet.  Really, everything was fantastic, with only moments of imperfection.  We have actual direwolves, proof Rickon Stark exists, and multiple moments of glorious badassery.  I loved the rewrite about how Drogo gets wounded.  It drives home what an amazing badass Drogo is, how savage the Dothraki are (apparently they use the Klingon rules of order), and it was fantastic to watch.  Only problem, his wound should have been bigger.  Special award goes to Catlyn, who was pitch perfect.  I still hate her character, but damn she's played by a good actress. 

Random thoughts:  I now wonder how exactly the casting went for Hodor.  ""It's a great part, trust me.  Well, you only have one line, but you say it a lot.  Oh, and you're swinging some serious pipe, right?""  Maester Lewin continues to be fantastic in every scene he's in.  I don't quite know how the actor does it, he never seems to DO anything, but every moment he's on screen he somehow manages to command my attention.  Selmy also continues to be absolutely perfect, as does the old bear."
1,8,The Pointy End,awww ser berristan aww
1,8,The Pointy End,"The hill tribes seemed too civilized to me. I expected them to be way more rugged. And their speech seemed too proper to me.

EDIT: typo"
1,8,The Pointy End,Watching this show there are times when I think I should just stop watching and make up my own ending.  I'm afraid some of my favourite characters are not going to survive the last few episodes.
1,8,The Pointy End,Syrio Forel and Barristan Selmy are such bosses. Next week's episode will be the epic to end all epics. 
1,8,The Pointy End,What if Dany has a girl instead of the boy she keeps promising?  I can see that being a major point later if it happens.
1,8,The Pointy End,"I really liked how, when the Great Jon Umber drew his sword in the dining hall against Robb, Theon was explicitly shown standing and drawing his weapon in response almost instantly. Far out. The show is making me really like and feel sorry for Theon, whereas I didn't care for him much in the books.

Also, if you pay attention in the scene where the Kingsguard are sheathing their swords after Barristan Selmy storms out, the guy on the right has heaps of difficulty shoving the sword back in. It's a pretty amusing aside, especially since his arm kind of shakes."
1,8,The Pointy End,"So Hodor is, uh, big."
1,8,The Pointy End,I wish this season would never end. 
1,8,The Pointy End,"[Time for Arya to shine!](/s ""Time for Arya to shine!"")"
1,8,The Pointy End,"Seriously epic episode. I really got chills watching this one. When Robb says ""Call the banners"" ""All of them."" and then you see the hundreds of crows flying everywhere.!"
1,8,The Pointy End,"(non-reader; speculation about next episodes coming up) [TV Spoiler](/s ""Robb will attack Jamie's forces, won't he? Tywin will assume that Robb is as much of a Lawful Stupid as his father, so he'll prepare for the attack, might even ask Jaime for reinforcements. This will, in turn, allow Robb to attack Jaime, catch his forces with their pants down, liberate the Riverlands and attack Tywin with the combined forces of the Riverlands and the North. That's the only tactical decision that makes any sense."")"
1,8,The Pointy End,I'm glad that they left Syrio's fate questionable like in the books. And I must add that seeing him take down several fully armored knights with a wooden sword was quite epic.
1,8,The Pointy End,I was a little disappointed by the Arya stabbing scene. They made it look like it was almost an accident stabbing the stableboy rather than her having clear intent to kill the kid like in the books.
1,8,The Pointy End,[deleted]
1,8,The Pointy End,Anyone notice that it's written by George R. R. Martin?
1,8,The Pointy End,Dude ripped that guys fucking tongue out.  End of story.
1,8,The Pointy End,"The only concern I have, and this is less about the episode than the series, is the direction they are taking Sansa. I'm going to be disappointed if they end up cutting the details on [Book Spoiler](/b ""what role Sansa played in the lead up to tonights episode"")"
1,8,The Pointy End,How fast do these birds deliver messages? A day? Two days?
1,8,The Pointy End,"Oh shit, did Syrio die?"
1,8,The Pointy End,"Ok, what is up with Sansa? Is she going to reach critical mass of being a bitch on wheels..."
1,8,The Pointy End,"Hmm, [TV Spoiler](/s ""Jon Snow's lantern throw at the wights was pretty weak, I thought. I imagined he had thrown an oil lamp and it had shattered on them while spilling oil down his arm?"")"
1,8,The Pointy End,[deleted]
1,8,The Pointy End,"Another episode, another batch of sympathetic characters with ambiguous fates. We're now up to Nymeria, Benjen, Arya, and Syrio (with some others). I really need some closure."
1,8,The Pointy End,And it is beginning!!! I'm more excited than Joffrey imagining his coronation!
1,8,The Pointy End,I love how they didn't show Syrio Forel's explicit death on screen. Is he still alive? Who knows?
1,8,The Pointy End,Great episode.  I expected something a bit more dramatic and less rushed in the scene where Arya stabbed the stableboy.
1,8,The Pointy End,Khal Drogo: the baddest of all the asses
1,8,The Pointy End,"+3 Arya Stark
+1 Sansa Stark
Even Ned Stark
+2 Kat Stark
-1 Robert Stark (for reminding me of Ned and his convictions)
-5 Joffrey 
+15 Syrio
+843209239009 Drogo"
1,8,The Pointy End,"Funny thing, at the point in the book where last week's cliffhanger happened (killing of Ned's men, capture of Ned), I misread it and thought that LittleFinger slit Ned's throat then gloated about it. Not exactly a misunderstanding you can make with a TV show. Still, even that doesn't compare to what these next three episodes should bring."
1,8,The Pointy End,I'm not sure a tongue being ripped through a open throat was enough to act as a climax to all the tension built this episode. Winter is coming ...
1,8,The Pointy End,I wonder what Arya's thinking now that she's got her first kill.
1,8,The Pointy End,[deleted]
1,8,The Pointy End,"It was awesome. Especially the part where [TV Spoiler](/s ""Varys frees Ned Stark with Ayra and Syrio Forel. Then proceed to epically battle their way onto the iron throne where Pyter Baelish turns the gold cloaks on the Lannisters"" ), but seriously this is abit early :p. "
1,8,The Pointy End,"Well that took me by surprise, almost glad I haven't read the books yet.  [TV Spoiler](/s ""I never would have expected Littlefinger to kill Dumbledore."")
"
1,8,The Pointy End,"DAE feel like Peter Dinklage was a little off tonight? He's been completely perfect up til now, but in tonight's episode I didn't love his delivery.

The ""bob loblaw with a maid's mouth around my cock"" line is one of my favorites of the series but I thought it came off as contrived here."
1,8,The Pointy End,"The highlight of the episode for me was Syrio being a total badass and Arya teaching that kid not to mess with her...but the episode managed to keep that tension throughout the 60 minutes.

I enjoyed the time with Robb...starting to like his character in the show even more.  [Book Spoiler](/b ""He'll have to fill Ned's shoes for me and until the Red Wedding [ :'( ] the actor will do a great job in Sean Bean's place."")

Tyrion was great as ever, and his story is taking an interesting turn....but wow, I already hate his father.

Cersei and Joffrey pissed me off as usual, but Sansa came off as somewhat likeable in at least trying to save her father, albeit naive [I guess it's a Stark thing].

The Dany/Drogo storyline in this episode was kind of the weak point for me, but once you realize where it's going (especially from the promo) you know it's about to hit the fan.

Next episode is going to be crazy. [Book Spoiler](/b ""I will miss you, Ned."")

"
1,8,The Pointy End,Can anyone explain why the Lannisters don't just kill Ned? Why hold him in a cell?
1,8,The Pointy End,Does this episode contain any nudity/sexy time? I'm living with very conversative relatives right now. Need to know before I watch the episode.
1,8,The Pointy End,Am I the only one who's starting to feel sorry for Joffrey? He seems like just a pawn in his mother's games.
1,8,The Pointy End,"Wow, I've never been so excited in my entire life... and so disappointed."
1,8,The Pointy End,"Is it just me, or did next episode's preview make it look like [Book Spoiler](/b ""Rob led the battle where the Northern foot got defeated by Tywin Lannister instead of Roose Bolton? I don't think they could cut out Bolton as he plays a pretty major role later on, but I haven't been able to find any information on whether or not he's in the show."") "
1,8,The Pointy End,"Went by too fast. Too much happened in this episode, it should have been two hours long."
1,8,The Pointy End,"The series has been brilliant so far, and the greatest joy is seeing it with my girlfriend who hasn't read the books, I almost envy her not knowing what's going to happen in the next two episodes...almost"
1,8,The Pointy End,Dexter descended from Arya.
1,8,The Pointy End,I liked the part with the aliens. That was unexpected. 
1,8,The Pointy End,[deleted]
1,8,The Pointy End,"less than 6 hours...  This episode is going to be epic.  Who am I kidding, *every* episode of this show is epic.  

But still, these last 3 episodes are going to blow peoples minds."
1,8,The Pointy End,aww man i can't wait for next week
1,8,The Pointy End,Great Episode! But why are they downplaying Ghost so much? He was there fighting the other in Moromont's room but in the show he was stuck outside.
1,8,The Pointy End,Why is ghost making so much goddamn noise?
1,8,The Pointy End,"I didn't like this episode personally.  As a book reader, I know that there was a lot of ground to cover in the episode, however I felt that it was too jumpy.  Some scenes were really quick and abbreviated.  I was especially looking forward to the Great Jon Umber but then it happened and I was a little let down."
1,8,The Pointy End,This tread has so far been as entertaining as I expect tonights episode to be.
1,8,The Pointy End,"Great episode.  Im only about 300 pages in to the book but I am pretty sure I will have it wrapped up before the finale.  Though I wonder if watching it first would be the better decision?  Thoughts?

I really cant wait to see where things go.  Are we going to get a big-ass battle scene on screen?  I have a feeling things don't turn out very well for Ned which kind of sucks as he is one of my favorites aspects of the book and show.  And I am a bit disappointed that we haven't seen much of the Others since their awesome debut though I imagine that shit-storm is coming in further seasons.  "
1,8,The Pointy End,"So why are the Lannisters attacking the Tully? I totally expected the Tully to support the Stark, but why not wait until the Stark forces were there? And if they were waiting, why are the Lannister attacking them? Also, I expected more commitment from the Vale."
1,8,The Pointy End,"Help me recap. From what we know (in the show, not the books, which I haven't read) so far, it's the Lannisters against the Starks and the Tullys, right? We don't know the position of the other houses yet, except for the Arryns, which seems to be determined to wait and see. The Baratheons (or at least Stannis) have received a message from Ned, but we don't know their response yet. Renly fled to the Tyrel, and we yet don't know what positon (if any) they will take. Nothing is known about the Greyjoys or any other house. Am I missing anything? I just want to have both sides of the conflict straight."
1,8,The Pointy End,Didn't try and kill me at the end like the previous few episodes. It just simmered along fucking brilliantly building to what I'm sure will be an awesome 2 episodes.
1,8,The Pointy End,Anybody else think the girl playing Sansa sucks?
1,8,The Pointy End,"Wait, I just read the  sidebar..  Jon's Mother's Identity? I read the books but forgot, is that a real spoiler?"
1,8,The Pointy End,"Tight butthole, folks. Definitely tight butthole."
1,8,The Pointy End,Dude ripped that guys fucking tongue out.  End of story.
1,8,The Pointy End,"""I remember when you came into this world, red faced and screaming."" Seriously, Don't fucking read the red section if you haven't finished all the available books. [bookspoiler](/b""Funny, that's how he leaves this world too"")"
1,8,The Pointy End,"Dum de dum dum, checking if my house tag's here yet."
1,8,The Pointy End,"wait? what?.... i really only commented to see if my house tag has taken effect yet.  tee hee
"
1,9,Baelor,"When Ned saw Arya as he was brought out to the square, I lost it."
1,9,Baelor,"Not that this will get much attention compared to the rest if the episode, but they nailed Drogo's sick tent. That scene was creepy as hell!"
1,9,Baelor,"I knew what was coming, and still my heart was absolutely racing. I kept shifting around on the couch because I was getting all flustered. It was even more heartwrenching than it was in the books, and I could really feel Sansa's and Arya's desperation and heartbreak. "
1,9,Baelor,"I am a book reader, and one thing that stood out to me was Sansa's reaction. Just seeing her up there, first all smug and happy thinking (not undeservedly) that she'd saved the day, and then seeing her entirely lose her shit as she realizes what Joffrey is doing. The show really bought that to life for me. That, and Ned spotting Arya on the statue, were the most heartbreaking moments for me. "
1,9,Baelor,"Now that you've been properly indoctrinated, allow me to reintroduce the author, [GRRM](http://i.imgur.com/mnBEH.jpg) "
1,9,Baelor,"Non-readers: I ***crave*** your reactions.

Also: man tears. Good lord."
1,9,Baelor,"Loved this episode, but I can't take Walder Frey seriously as I can only see him as Filch from Harry Potter."
1,9,Baelor,"The way Tywin Lannister delivers, ""[TV Spoiler](/s ""With his other eighteen thousand men."")"" was kind of just perfect.

Edit: I think it was my favorite part of this episode."
1,9,Baelor,"You know, there's an awful lot about Ned here this week, but I really felt Tyrion's scene in which he describes what Tywin did to his ""wife"", the silver slipping through her fingers, was *nailed* by Dinklage.

Enjoy the setup."
1,9,Baelor,"Also, I wish they mentioned who's sword was used to execute Ned."
1,9,Baelor,"As soon as I saw Arya enter the square and climb up on the statue, the whole scene from the book came flooding back to me. I mean, I was expecting this scene all along, but they really captured the same feeling I got from the book. The scene was basically perfect.

I wanted to look away too."
1,9,Baelor,[deleted]
1,9,Baelor,[deleted]
1,9,Baelor,"I think it was brilliant to end the scene in a sort of quiet way, they toned down all the noise as a warning to brace yourself. The filming mimicked an adrenaline rush or something similar to what you would feel in Ned's situation. "
1,9,Baelor,I wept bitter man tears.
1,9,Baelor,[deleted]
1,9,Baelor,"FUCKING A. So it's like that, huh? It's one of those stories? I feel so manipulated. The author truly must be a piece of work. Create a character, make him upstanding and moral. Build him up. Make him a family man. Make him stand for honor, and truth. Make him an ""every man"", but make him regal, respected. Make him perfectly flawed, so that we struggle with him. [TV Spoiler](/s ""And then, chop his fucking head off. Unceremoniously. Oh, but before you do that, break him."") It's like being 8 and watching your father cry for the first time. 

Well, Mr. GRRM, you son of a bitch. I'm on to you. You won't get me again. Just like Buttercup, my heart is now a secret garden and the walls are very high."
1,9,Baelor,"I cried. I've read the book but the look on Arya's face was heartbreaking!
And lets not get started on the Khal..."
1,9,Baelor,[deleted]
1,9,Baelor,"I don't know why no one else cowers at the sight of Tywin Lannister, he's so passively evil it's scary."
1,9,Baelor,YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS YOU LITTLE SHIT
1,9,Baelor,"[TV Spoiler](/s ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NED!!!"")

Fuck, that was painful to watch.

Joffrey can go straight to hell.

EDIT: Promo for next week looks insane as well...I have no clue how I'm gonna survive the break till next season!"
1,9,Baelor,I've been waiting for this episode since before the season even started. I'm so excited I can hardly contain myself.
1,9,Baelor,"Everything else has been discussed in depth, but one small thing stuck out to me in the ending: did anyone else notice that Sansa's hair was done in the same style as Cersei's? I thought that was a nice touch."
1,9,Baelor,"I was caught up to episode 8 in the book so this episode was completely new material to me minus Tyrion's story about his bride.

I expected the death of Ned, and I really had a hunch that the bastard Joffry would call for his head even if he confessed.  However I thought it would come from his mother as well but it seems clear that she didn't think he would do such a thing. I hope that rotten shit gets his just desserts some day and what I wouldn't give for it to be via Robb.  

The biggest shock to me was the capture of that asshole Kingslayer, that is a fricken HUGE moment.  When they road across I thought oh joy, they at least survived and won a battle elsewhere but I had no clue they would have him with them, aka the ultimate bargaining chip with the queen aside from maybe Joffry himself.

And while I may not want Danerys to succeed long term and in turn Rhaego to sit on the throne I really hope that that this isn't the end of Drogo.  He is just too awesome.

Fantastic episode.  I think I am going to read up to where episode 9 ends in the book and let the show surprise me for the finale once again.  Then this summer I'll just read the rest of them."
1,9,Baelor,"That was great,  though I do hope they get the budget to show some battles next season.  Would have been great to see the Robb vs Jamie fight.

Spoiler question kind of,  did they go into detail with these battles in the book?"
1,9,Baelor,:O
1,9,Baelor,"From book:
He cocked his head to one side. “I am Tyrion, of
House Lannister. Men call me the Imp.”
“My mother named me Shae. Men call
me . . . *often*.”

I really wanted to hear this dialogue.  HBO Y u cut out the funnies."
1,9,Baelor,"Reader here: That last scene was fantastically done.  I mean,  [TV Spoiler](/s ""I always liked ned's character. It's hard to dislike someone for being honourable"") and I was worried about how it was going to be handled-- especially after I felt several important scenes werent given enough attention. I was disappointed by Tyrion not getting a little combat in before he was knocked out -- although his speech to the troops was pretty awesome. 

The actor who played Robb kicked ass tonight -- Looking forward to more from him in future episodes. And Jon's bit at the beginning was good, but whenever I see him staring with his mouth open I can't help but think of that gormless comic. . ."
1,9,Baelor,[deleted]
1,9,Baelor,"Not to be lost in this epic episode is my favorite exchange so far.

Bronn: ""Stay Low""

Tyrian: ಠ_ಠ ""Stay Low????!!!""

EDIT: thanks for langlier for pointing out that it wasn't ""lay low"""
1,9,Baelor,"What I don't get is why Ned didn't start screaming ""Joffrey is an incestuous bastard child of dirty inbreeding Lannisters and I'm not actually a traitor"" when it became apparent he was going to be murdered. I mean the man is all about honour and he sacrificed his honour to survive and didn't survive...so might as well try and salvage your honour right?"
1,9,Baelor,I wish they would show the direwolves more. I would've loved to have seen Grey Wind running along with Robb after the battle.
1,9,Baelor,"Man even though I knew what was going to happen from reading the books I still almost lost it at the end of the episode, it was so well done."
1,9,Baelor,"A few questions, the comments have kind of answered them, but I want to be sure:

The sword used at the end of the episode, is that Ned's sword? (The one he used to execute the deserter?)

Who is that dude who grabbed Arya? I thought I knew all the characters, but I must have missed one.

Oh also, HOLY SHIT. I totally didn't see that coming. It's a shame, since I thought he would have been around for seasons to come."
1,9,Baelor,"I understand why they didn't really have the budget to show the battles, but I wish a) they'd gone into more detail as to the Stark army's plan and how they won/got Jaime, because it was absolutely brilliant in the book, and b) did you have to knock out Tyrion before the battle even began?! Come on... he was such a badass in battle, at least give him an equally badass story, even if you can't show it. Bah."
1,9,Baelor,"I think the main reason why I am so ""holy shit' is about this is that if you are gonna put Sean Bean's face on most of GoT shit, how the hell you gonna kill him in Season 1? 

Not complaining though, this show dont fuck around."
1,9,Baelor,"Even though I have read the books, there were some things I had forgotten. I had forgotten what an awesome, horny old codger Walder Frey was. I had forgotten who Maester Aemon was. What a treat it was to see the actors playing them revel in those performances too. 

I wish I could have forgotten the ending, but god damn that was [TV Spoiler](/s ""powerful sad"") and exactly like I imagined it from the book. 

And when the [TV Spoiler](/s ""horse got its throat slit"") - yeah, that made me kind of sick - but in the good way.

Also, anyone else feel like this episode looked more like a movie? The cinematography was incredibly beautiful and every scene worked so well leading into the next that I forgot I was watching a television series. I can't believe that after 9 episodes this show is still getting better. "
1,9,Baelor,"Strictly a TV series watcher (so far) and myy mind was blown.  Ned, end, dead. "
1,9,Baelor,"Even though I knew it was coming, I just sat there thinking, ""Holy shit!  They're really gonna do it!?!""

It takes MASSIVE balls to kill off your star like that."
1,9,Baelor,i wished they would have done at least one of the battle scenes.
1,9,Baelor,"I was a little disappointed to have missed two large battles, but I can't say I was left wanting. They handled it well enough.

And, Walder ... what a lecherous pustule he was. Great casting."
1,9,Baelor,So in last episode's discussion I mentioned I was starting to feel sorry for Joffrey. Yeah... not anymore. Even the bitch Cersei realized that killing Ned was killing any chance for peace.
1,9,Baelor,did anyone else feel this episode was paced better than the last?
1,9,Baelor,"Okay, there is one thing that is confusing me a tid bit. When Snow received that very snazzy sword from the commander of the Nights Watch, he stated that his son has dishonored the house and fled, but had the good grace to leave the sword. I just read that this commanders name is Jeor Mormont so is the son he is speaking of Jorah Mormont? And if so, why the hell did Jorah not take that badass sword with him? "
1,9,Baelor,"Anyone notice that the High Septon's mercy speech was given to Grand Maester Pycelle?
It struck me during the scene since it was sort of strange to hear a Maester preaching about the seven gods, but it seems like most people were too caught up with the other events going on at the time :)
I understand they probably did it to reduce the number new speaking characters, but I think they've really glossed over the different religions so far.  Oh well, things should be more fleshed out in the second season."

1,9,Baelor,"Readers. Could you please answer me from 1-10 how devastating tonight's event was compared to the shape of things to come?

*Edit:* Thanks guys...I've been following the books along with the show exclusively for the first season. This is going to be one gut-wrenching ride after the finale, it seems."
1,9,Baelor,"did Shae seem off to anyone else? in the book she came off as more girly. also, Sean Beans dead, that was pretty fantastic. "
1,9,Baelor,"The good news is Walder Frey was spot on as a dirty, angry old man,  Jaime was, as always, perfect, and everyone at the wall continues to be excellent.  I'm also intrigued at the changes they've made to Shae's character.  It'll be interesting to see where they go with her.  She isn't book Shae, but she seems more like someone Tryion would actually be interested in for something besides fucking.

The bad news is that pacing problems were back with a vengeance.   Most of the scenes in tonights episodes felt rushed.  Robbs speech after the whispering woods was unneeded, and I really didn't like Tyrion not fighting.  It is extremely hard to imagine the Tywin we see on the screen [Book Spoiler](/b ""sending a Tyrion he seems to have completely contempt for to KL to run the kingdoms.  In the books, the battle was an important way for Tyrion to impress both his father and his clansmen"")"
1,9,Baelor,HOUSE STARK WILL BE AVENGED.
1,9,Baelor,"Maybe some who has the books can answer my question.  Does it say what Ned was whispering in the final scene?  And if so, what the hell was he saying."
1,9,Baelor,"I just reread book one, and I'm confused by one of the changes they made.  [Book Spoiler](/b ""Didn't Rob send most of infantry on the Tywin side of the river so that they could attack and maybe win?  He then took the cavalry and sprinted to Jaime.  Maybe it doesn't matter in the end?"")"
1,9,Baelor,"As a non-reader I got excited that perhaps Arya would run up and kill Joffery with her sword, then BAM! ""Woah"" was said for the next minute."
1,9,Baelor,"Right up until the last moment I was expecting Arya to throw Needle, slaying either the executioner or Joffrey or both, allowing a daring escape of the Starke household to prepare for an all-out battle to fucking god damnnit I hate the Lannisters."
1,9,Baelor,had to hit this mf a decade later
1,9,Baelor,Anyone else find it odd how they handled Tyrion's battle? IIRC there was a whole elaborate fight that took place
1,9,Baelor,"The only thing that bugged me was [TV Spoiler](/s ""Tyrion getting knocked out by his own comrade's hammer, then waking up in the middle of the aftermath of the battle. How the hell does that work? How does he go from in the middle of tents to the middle of a field of corpses?"") It didn't seem to make sense. I know why they would try to do something like this, as it's much cheaper than filming even a partial battle, but to me it was awkward."

1,9,Baelor,So there's one more episode left that's coming on this Sunday?  I thought I saw somewhere that there were three more eps in the season?
1,9,Baelor,"Anyone else think it was misleading for HBO to advertise Game of Thrones as ""The show with Sean Bean?"" Having read the books, I'm glad Ned's death happened onscreen instead of between chapters. And it was a seriously chilling scene. Still, knowing it was coming, I can't help but feel like the show's been trying too hard to make Ned Stark more of a hero than the book did just to make killing him off more of a shock."
1,9,Baelor,So immediately after this episode I read the rest of GOT from that point on and then just read Clash of Kings over the course of 2 days.  My fucking head is filled to the brim with epicness and sadness and more titles and characters than I thought possible for a series.  Pumped to start Storm of Swords tomorrow after recharging the batteries.

Also, the whole, ""you won't hear me scream,"" ""YES I WILL"" exchange was awkward. I know the same lines were in the book, but I felt they could have done it better than having Mirri yell from off-camera.

Robb beating a tree with his sword was weird, but the conversation with Cat made up for it. It felt like a good contrast to the 1-on-1 Cersei had with Joffrey. (The one were she told him anyone who wasn't ""one of us"" is an enemy.)"

Is this how the rest of the great Characters in the story going to die?  If so, then I should keep myself calm if any character starts to develop into any type of badass.  "

the pycelle scene sucked and was completely irrelevant in the last friggin episode of the season - it's not like there wasn't enough stuff to show.
the king of the north scene was about 30 minutes too early.
why did they interrupt jon's escape?

2,1,The North Remembers,"Oddly enough, having read the books, I do not find myself particularly engaged with Dany's storyline anymore. I really enjoy the scenes in King's Landing.  Those were excellent, and the writing is still fantastic. As the first episode of the season, expectations were obviously high, and it met most of mine. I know from other big dramas like Mad Men and Breaking Bad, the first episode is always the *big setup*, and this was no different. Much like MM last week, I was entertained for the entirety of the episode, so that was definitely a good sign for the rest of the season. 

I like the actor they chose for Davos...fits so perfectly. Stannis will definitely take some getting used to (I always pictured him differently) but I can't wait for the bigger battles. "

2,1,The North Remembers,"I'm not sure if anyone else has mentioned it, but the way they done Bran's wolf dreams was alot more than i expected, but exactly how i pictured it. Absolutley fantastic!
I also love the lines Joffrey had. It looks asthough it's started about 200 pages into the book, so this episode pretty much covered everything that needed covering.

I was happy they put in the glowing of the red gem on Melisandre's neck, it shows that they will add in the little details all the way through.

"
2,1,The North Remembers,Why isn't Jaime being held at Riverrun?
2,1,The North Remembers,The way they chopped everything together it should have been a two hour season premere so that it wasn't five or ten minutes with each character.
2,1,The North Remembers,Did anyone else notice that the amulet on Melisandre's neck was glowing when Master Cressen lies on the ground poisoned? 
2,1,The North Remembers,"More thoughts...

There was a lot of superb acting in this ep. The King's Landing intro really stands out. Not just Dinklage (who I could just watch all day), but Headey is a perfect Cersei, and Gleeson is really, really good. He just nails the evil/cowardly/are you making fun of me? Joffrey looks. And there's some little things, too. Notice Sansa, even in the midst of her deer-in-the-headlights nightmare gives Tyrion a What the Fuck is That? look when he first shows up. [Mild ASOS Spoiler](/b ""Foreshadowing!"")
The Robb vs. Jamie conversation is brilliant, too, as well as the Robb & Catelyn interaction. I'm starting to really like Robb. [ASOS Spoiler](/b ""ohgodwhy."")

The Littlefinger scene with Cersei is interesting. It reiterates his backstory (in case you didn't notice it last season, amongst the moaning whores). It seems like it might be a bit out of character for Littlefinger to overplay like that, but [ASOS Spoiler](/b ""it kind of sets things up for his participation in Joffrey's murder, which is otherwise sort of baffling."") And Cersei's reaction is brilliant. Headey is almost making me like? Cersei? WTF? She's an evil bitch, but she's an *awesome* evil bitch. 

(I realize I'm probably jumping in too late here, but what the hey)."
2,1,The North Remembers,"Was it just me, or did anyone else think that the sex scene towards the end was completely unnecessary? It seems like they're forcing them just for the sake of having sex scenes."
2,1,The North Remembers,only took half an hour to do the prologue
2,1,The North Remembers,"Did they change actors for Gendry? My friend and I thought he looked different, but he was onscreen for such a brief time it was hard to tell. IMDB doesn't even list Gendry as being in the episode, but they DO list people like Brienne and Margaery so the cast list appears suspect..."
2,1,The North Remembers,[deleted]
2,1,The North Remembers,I go to college with Jack Gleeson (prince joffrey). I don't really know the guy but I'm really tempted to slap him. You think he would mind?
2,1,The North Remembers,[removed]
2,1,The North Remembers,"That dude up north has sex with his daughters, and takes them for wives? and then he rinses, and repeats? ""That is foul"" "
2,1,The North Remembers,Why did they kill Dani's horse? That's her Silver!
2,1,The North Remembers,"Brilliant episode.

And I love how brutal this show is.  Near the end where they started to kill all the bastards...  Just the thought of an infant getting killed disturbs the fuck out of me. "
2,1,The North Remembers,"I actually felt sorry for Cersei in this episode. 
Except when she threatened Littlefinger.  
Stannis is PERFECT. I disliked him intensely. XD"
2,1,The North Remembers,"And my hate for Joffrey continues to grow with each episode!

I was hoping for more Arya but It'll have to wait <3"
2,1,The North Remembers,"Can anyone confirm whether this is the first time a baby has been murdered while a show was rolling? (audio-only, yes, but still) Then we see it carried away. I about lost my fourthmeal on that one."
2,1,The North Remembers,"kinda small but the way tyrion said ""of course you are"" after sansa said her mother and brother are traitors and she is loyal to joffrey was awesome. even the face he made and everything really made that scene for me."
2,1,The North Remembers,"I have 3 questions:

* Who are those people on a beach performing fire sword ritual?

* Who are the people that writing a letter to everyone saying Joffrey is not King Robert's son

* Who lady Stark is leaving to see in the morning to forge an alliance. 


Thank you in advance"
2,1,The North Remembers,"what was lord commander angry with Jon Snow? what did Snow do exactly that was so bad? how did he not ""follow""? he just talked! I don't get it. was that part different in the books? "
2,1,The North Remembers,"I thought Melisandre wasn't quite... right? I don't know. She didn't have quite the *presence* I was hoping for. She didn't feel quite as Red and Terrible as I was picturing. However, there's an awful lot of screen time to go for her and she may start to shine. 

Also, am I crazy but was she just speaking with an American accent? Am I misremembering? I suppose if, for purposes of the show, Westerosi = English accent, it could make sense to have exotic/Asshai = American accent. (Note: The US is in the Shadow under Asshai!)  Maybe that's why she didn't seem quite as Serious as she ought; her voice seemed too mundane."
2,1,The North Remembers,TIL not to trust 4chan streamers...
2,1,The North Remembers,No prologue? I am disappoint. They could have at least compromised and used the scene of the gods burning on the beach to build Stannis and Melisandre up a little more. I don't think this episode really did much to establish just how colossal these figures are in the overall narrative. 
2,1,The North Remembers,"Did anyone else think of School House Rock when Littlefinger told Cersei that ""knowledge is power"" ?"
2,1,The North Remembers,Joffery heard that his mom fucked his uncle. Who the hell had the balls to share that gossip with him?
2,1,The North Remembers,Someone NEEDS to gif that Jeoffrey slap!
2,1,The North Remembers,"I'm curious, in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=VARwvVJxnYw#t=104s), the actor playing Stannis mentions that ""Stannis is most definitely falling under [Melisandre's] spell."" 

[Speculation](/g ""Isn't it the case that Stannis knows better than to believe in Melisandre's God, but chooses to go along with her anyway since she's helping his cause?"")


Also, why is Shae living in the Hand's room with Tyrion in the TV show? 

[Speculation](/g ""Didn't she live in one of the whorehouses in the book?"")"
2,1,The North Remembers,Did they change the actor for the blacksmith's boy?
2,1,The North Remembers,Watching joff get slapped was the highlight of the episode for me
2,1,The North Remembers,"I enjoyed the scenes between Cersei and Littlefinger and Cersei and Joffrey. I think both were well done and helps develop her character more. I also was really shocked with all the heir hunting, I dont recall that scene in the book either. 

Overall I loved it, great way to start off season 2."
2,1,The North Remembers,"I had great expectations for this episode, and as the chapter was about to end I was disappointed, then they started killing babyes and then understood why it had to be low violence until the end "
2,1,The North Remembers,"I loved Grey Wind, and Janos Slynt is a asshole."
2,1,The North Remembers,"I pictured Stannis as more of a mean and savage looking dude, more [like this:](http://gameofthrones.net/images/House_Baratheon/Stannis_Baratheon.jpg)"
2,1,The North Remembers,"The Good: Robb & Jaime, Cersei and Littlefinger (not in the books, but it was interesting), the City Watch killing the bastards (really cool how they bring it out when the books only mentioned them as an afterthought).

The Bad: the burning of the Seven and Master Cressen trying to poison Melisandre.....that was really weird and awkward.

And does anyone else think Davos and Stannis should switch actors?

Also that little bit with Robb and Catelyn arguing...I imagined Catelyn more composed and careful with what she said to Robb due to the monologue running through her mind about how she had to be careful to counsel her newly crowned son advice."
2,1,The North Remembers,"Good episode. Diehard fan of the books, but I have no issue with the streamlining that they're doing. There's still plenty of nuance and detail to soak up, I enjoyed it thoroughly, and find myself disliking Melisandre already, which is a great sign. "
2,1,The North Remembers,"I was a little bit disappointed they didn't stick too tightly to the books.  The series felt more natural when they had lines straight out of the book, but I saw multiple scenes that were different.

Also a tiny bit disappointed that they didn't continue with the person dying in opening sequence theme."
2,1,The North Remembers,"A few random observations:

- did they ever so slightly change the theme music? It sounds a bit...remixed. Like they made certain instruments more clearer.

- everything looks so much more cinematic, what with all these vast shots of the Red Waste and King's Landing. Really impressive.

- Everyone is great but Jack Gleeson is again the stand out for me. His final scene with Cersei was pure brilliance, I'm loving the scenes that aren't in the book. That close up of him threatening his mother was downright terrifying.

- Ros repeating part of Littlefinger's speech from last season word for word was pretty lame. The bit when the guards came in, however, was really well done (and really horrible at the same time). The montage and ending on Arya was really well done.

- Are they setting things up for a City Watch mutiny of some sort? There were more than a few shots of some City Watch guys looking terrified at what they were been asked to do.

- Already love Stannis and Davos, two very talented actors there.

- Dany is still the most boring character. I don't think much happens to her in the book apart from one particular chapter,"
2,1,The North Remembers,"I loved Davos and Stannis, can't wait for Brienne.

My favorite scene of the entire episode was when they cut to Gendry and Arya from Janos Slynt slaughtering the bastards... chills.

Also we had our first on screen-wolf dream. I think the way they chose to do it worked pretty well. That's pretty much how I imagined they would do the wolf dreams."
2,1,The North Remembers,"I really love that guy they cast as Stannis.  The scene where he's adding all those arbitrary edits to the letter was a perfect introduction to the character.  Not quite sure about Melisandre yet...she doesn't seem as spooky as I imagined her in the books.

Davos bored me in the books, but I really like the actor they cast so I have higher hopes for his storyline on the show this season."
2,1,The North Remembers,"It's probably been said before, but damn, i think that actor who's playing as Osha is doing it extremely well. It is just as i imagined her. Bronn and ser Jorah Mormont are spot on as well, Davos too."
2,1,The North Remembers,"Everyone disappointed about the lack of Arya realizes this was intentional, right? Nobody is going to stop watching the show because they didn't see _enough_ of Arya!

And then they mentioned her. Often. How important finding her was. And that builds up to the last scene where you're reminded where she is and how much danger she's about to be in. Creating, you know, suspense. "
2,1,The North Remembers,"When Littlefinger told Cersei that, ""Knowledge is power,"" and she had her guards turn and walk three paces and close their eyes and said, ""Power is power."" Chills!"
2,1,The North Remembers,TIL reddit sucks for live discussions. you guys are so dead compared to /tv/.
2,1,The North Remembers,I love the sound of Dothraki in the evening.
2,1,The North Remembers,"I am a little underwhelmed. Im a huge fan of WOW openers, but im really happy with it nonetheless. It did feel like it was more of a second or third episode in the series but they did follow the books so far quite well. Also I wish melisandre was cast differently, i love her in the books but in the show im not a fan yet. She's not... strong enough."
2,1,The North Remembers,how come the lady in red wasn't affected by the poison?
2,1,The North Remembers,"Did anyone else think Craster was a little to groomed?  Bar that, I thought his character came across well."
2,1,The North Remembers,"Fed up of trying to find a stream, fuck it I'll just read your comments instead (I've read the books)."
2,1,The North Remembers,[removed]
2,1,The North Remembers,"Ok, I have HBOGo, but have never used it before.  Will it stream episodes simultaneously with HBO?

Edit: So it is kinda late now, but yeah, it did stream it.  It didn't show up until around 9:10 for some reason, but it ended up showing up. "
2,1,The North Remembers,"There was a certain scene for the Spartacus season finale
[r/Spartacus_TV](http://www.reddit.com/r/Spartacus_TV/) which shocked me pretty good then HBO just one ups them and I was speechless. Well played HBO well played indeed.
"
2,1,The North Remembers,"Awesome start, showed what everyone was doing!

Plus I have to say, as a foreigner, that the fact that it premiered SIMULTANEOUSLY worldwide was the most awesome thing ever!"
2,1,The North Remembers,"that feel when cant read this, even if I have read the books"
2,1,The North Remembers,"Oh, I feel like Beyond the Wall didn't look dangerous enough. It was sunny outside for God's sake. They could have at least tried to make it look a little more wild. Other than that...perfect."
2,1,The North Remembers,"Not enough Arya, wish they had Theons first chapter as well
"
2,1,The North Remembers,I'm surprised how fast the show is moving. It seems like they should be getting to some really fun sequences sooner than later.
2,1,The North Remembers,Anyone notice Cassie from Skins? Oh wow!
2,1,The North Remembers,one things I didn't understand. why did they start killing kids
2,1,The North Remembers,"I am just so excited to have the show back on, and more so that it's shaping up to be a really action packed season. The acting is better on everyones part, and each role is much more potent. Stoked :)"
2,1,The North Remembers,Now I understand why Ros had to be in the episode. Not that I ever understood the massive hate in the first place.
2,1,The North Remembers,Is anyone else disappointed that Shae was in the Tower of the King...? That's like a big issue. And if Alyanana isn't introduced..[Book Spoiler](/ACOC who does Cersei promise to kill if Tyrion doesn't return Tommen to Kings Landing?)
2,1,The North Remembers,"I'm wasn't sure exactly if this was the right place for me to post a ""play-by-play"" but I read what I thought was an interesting (helpful?) article:['Game of Thrones' season 2 premiere recap: 'The North Remembers.'

"
2,1,The North Remembers,"One cool thing I noticed - when they were talking to Stannis and it mentioned that Mace Tyrell and Randyll Tarly had declared for Renly. I look forward to hopefully [All books spoilers](/b ""seeing what Tarly is like in later books."")
 "
2,1,The North Remembers,"[ACOK Spoiler](/b ""I still don't understand why they changed Cleos Frey for some Lannister."")"
2,1,The North Remembers,"I wonder do they plan to include the [book spoiler] (/b ""frey kids at winterfell"") Or was it that they were introduced at book three? can remember for sure. "
2,1,The North Remembers,What was the deal with the guy who banged all of his daughters?
2,1,The North Remembers,[deleted]
2,1,The North Remembers,Im only halfway thru ACok and I didn't understand the scene with Cersei and Petyr. Does that happen later or was it just Hollywood. Or maybe I missed that part in the book as I sometimes lose track in books with subconscious thinking.
2,1,The North Remembers,"Got a 2 quick questions for you gents and ladies.

I'm watching the show in Denmark, with no subs... so sometimes it can be hard following all the conversations.

1.
Why did they have to kill all the kids/babies ? I guess they were looking for the last Stark girl? But why kill the babies? Will somebody think about the children? I don't get this.

2.
The priest who died from drinking his own poison, did this take place in the far north? I can't really remember those kings/lords from season 1.
They were the once, who have their own king and once were at war with the Starks for independence, right?"
2,1,The North Remembers,Winter is has come!
2,1,The North Remembers,I fucking hated how ham-fisted Ser Dontos's heraldry was. It wasn't even clever or anything.
2,1,The North Remembers,I wanted a proper prolog... =(
2,1,The North Remembers,"I wasn't impressed.  While grateful for the series, and knowing you need to lay groundwork, it wasn't terribly interesting except maybe the last five minutes."
2,1,The North Remembers,Did Rakharo get recast? I thought he looked different but I could be wrong.
2,1,The North Remembers,"Honestly I expected a lot more from Arya and the Khaleesi, but I guess we'll be seeing a lot of them in the upcoming weeks "
2,1,The North Remembers,Who is that guy who is with Slynt when they execute the bastard baby in the brothel? The one who nods at the sight of the baby boy. 
2,1,The North Remembers,"That is one ending to an episode that I will never forget.

The night is dark and full of terrors."
2,1,The North Remembers,Ok so who thought that this episode was to spread out across the entire continent and should have focused a little more on king's landing. Good start but i thought it could have been better
2,1,The North Remembers,"I saw S1 before I read the books. TBH, I wish I didn't read the books. The excitement is no longer there.  I will have to wait until S3 for things to get juicy. I did notice that Joffrey seems to be more stern towards his mother in the TV series. "
2,1,The North Remembers,"Maybe it's just me, but i'm not sure Richard Madden does it for me as Robb. I know it's very early in the season to say i don't like him, but now that i've noticed how he makes that snarly face almost every other word i'm just not sure"
2,1,The North Remembers,"Don't know if anyone's mentioned it specifically, but the wolf-dream cam was awesome."
2,1,The North Remembers,"I don't know about the rest of you but I was watching with a group of three people who hadn't read the book and one person (besides me) who had. The two of us just kept looking at each other at every awesome part and just going ""they've got no idea"" because it just keeps getting better and better."
2,1,The North Remembers,"Thoughts; Wow, people weren't kidding; Littlefinger acted soo uncharactistically stupid that I'd consider it character derailment. Of course, this is only episode one. Maybe he did it on purpose (Afterall, Cersei thinking she's a boss never goes well for her). Also, We hardly got inside Stannis or his follower's heads. Those chatpers were big on touching why Cressen (not even named :/) and Davos follow him. I hope we get inside his head more as the show goes on. Those were some of my favorite chapters in the book. Aside from those and the teasers on Ayra and Dany, I enjoyed the stuff with Robb, The Royal Court, and Jon. I really liked Ser Dontos' scene too."
2,1,The North Remembers,I didn't quite get the ending of the episode. More particularly are we supposed to know who ordered the baby murder and I missed it somehow (didn't get it) or we aren't?
2,1,The North Remembers,Anyone else curious if that is the way Lightbringer will look all season? I really was expecting something great but it seems like it was just on fire...and not glowing like it does in the books.
2,1,The North Remembers,"Be honest, gents. On first impression alone, do you think Carice Van Houten is going to be a good Melisandre? Don't get me wrong, she most definitely looks the part. She's how I pictured the character to look. 

However when it comes to her acting performance.....I was sadly unimpressed. I picture Melisandre being grim, severe, and very scary. Carice made her seem arrogant. Arrogance is not a quality Melisandre possesses. She has no need for it.

I also would say a few words about Stephen Dillane's performance as Stannis Baratheon. First off, he doesn't look the part in my eyes. Stannis Baratheon is mostly bald with jet black hair like his brothers and last I checked he also had a thick stubble or beard. Stannis is also very severe and intimidating, like Melisandre. He doesn't exude severity or strength the way he does in the books. This line here: ""Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark they're all thieves, they will bend the knee or I will destroy them."" It should have given me goosebumps. It didn't. I personally feel that Mark Strong would have been an excellent choice.

I know it was just the first episode, and there's still room for improvement but it upsets me to see two of my favorite characters from the books mishandled in such a way. Don't get me wrong. They are capable actors but these characters need actors that are more than just simply capable."
2,1,The North Remembers,"Did anyone else notice that [Ros](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm213758464/nm2657974) got fat?

Edit: No idea why there are downvotes. I just made a passive observation, and it seems like there are many who agree with me."
2,1,The North Remembers,I am sitting in highschool Sociology dearly hoping that my teacher doesn't want to check my work. 
2,1,The North Remembers,I am confused about the whole child killing thing. Was the baby they killed Littlefinger's? Also I thought they were just looking for Arya but they killed random boys
2,1,The North Remembers,"Stephen Dillane was an absolutely horrible choice for Stannis. He neither looked the part nor possessed Stannis's cold and steely demeanor. I was, however, quite pleased with all of the other new characters and settings they introduced."
2,1,The North Remembers,could someone explain to me why guards stormed into baelish's brothel and killed the baby? why did they go around killing other dudes after that and drowning people? i thought baelish had nothing to do with arya since he betrayed ned and all.
2,1,The North Remembers,finally the wait is over!
2,1,The North Remembers,So has riverrun been cut probably because of money?
2,1,The North Remembers,"I think they did Catelyn a disservice in this episode. She explodes on Robb trying to tell him what to do, such as trading Jamie for the girls. In the books she seems to have such a cool head and never lets her emotions dictate her actions[Book Spoiler](/b ""until she lets the Kingslayer go"") , especially towards Robb. She always seemed so collected and above her true feelings, in this episode she seemed like a frantic mother, not the mother to the King in the North. Only complaint from me, that was a great start to the season!"
2,1,The North Remembers,"as much as I enjoy a good joffrey slap, that scene seemed a bit out of place from the books.  I thought it was well acted, you can see lena realizing she may have crossed a line, but i don't remember anything like that from the books, maybe I'm just forgetting..."
2,1,The North Remembers,"Sorry, I have a few dumb questions, if someone could please enlighten me? 

1) Why did the priestess survive when she drank the poisoned wine, but the other priest died? 
2) What's with the massacre of the babies at the end of the episode? I assume this has something to do with Cercei trying to kill all possible sons of the King? "
2,2,The Night Lands,I love how Tyrion puts his hand on the door to stop Varys from leaving. Varys responds by putting his finger on the door to keep Tyrion from leaving.
2,2,The Night Lands,"Ghost looks ridiculously badass now.  CGI does a direwolf good.

I just wish they brought out more red in his eyes, like the previous one."
2,2,The Night Lands,Jaqen!
2,2,The Night Lands,"Making Bronn commander of the Goldcloaks is a brilliant move.  Some fans are disappointed with a few of the grander and less sentimental slashes, cuts, and alterations that the show has made from the books, but I think D&D have shown a deft hand in being very economical with the broader strokes of the series, keeping many of the emotional and larger thematic elements intact and well transcribed.  This is clearly because of GRRM's involvement with the show; his television experience and willingness to put his work under the knife to translate it, combined with D&D's talents, are realling making this a completely new animal.  As a fan of the books, it's so exciting to tune in and be *surprised* by this story I am so familiar with and fond of."
2,2,The Night Lands,"""They killed her baby!""

""Ah, yes, that was.....poorly handled.""

So much tact, Littlefinger. "
2,2,The Night Lands,I really loved the first scene with Yoren. He was just as cool as a cucumber.
2,2,The Night Lands,"I don't remember Jon Snow getting smacked in the face by Craster. and I was legitimately upset when they killed Rakkharo. For that matter, I didnt like it when Dany's silver died in the previous episode, but that was just a horse."
2,2,The Night Lands,I say we Yield. 
2,2,The Night Lands,I'd hope they play up Davos grabbing his pouch of fingers more. It's almost like his OCD thing
2,2,The Night Lands,"""The Episode is dark and full of sex."""
2,2,The Night Lands,I'll give Melissandre a 10/10 for sultriness. The look on Stannis' face when his eyes first caught sight of some boob was hilarious. 
2,2,The Night Lands,They're really making up for the comparatively sex-light season opener.  
2,2,The Night Lands,Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs! :D
2,2,The Night Lands,RIP Rakharo. 
2,2,The Night Lands,"Did you pay the iron price, or the gold?"
2,2,The Night Lands,"God, Cersei is just *so damn good.* [AFFC/ADWD](/b ""I love how you can already see the crazy starting to form."") I can't get over how fantastic of an actress Lena Headey is. "
2,2,The Night Lands,"I truly cannot wait to see [ACoK](/b ""Hot Pie yell HOOOOT PIEEEEEE!!!"")"
2,2,The Night Lands,A man has a thirst. A thirst for next week's episode.
2,2,The Night Lands,Wait a sec... did they write out Stannis' daughter?
2,2,The Night Lands,"I am so happy I resisted the temptation to watch this early.  

Also... fish pie. Tee hee."
2,2,The Night Lands,"The cinematography is really something. They capture the essence of these fantasy worlds so well, I become completely immersed in the world whenever I watch, even though it's through a screen. Considering it's a tv show, I'm always amazed how they create such beautiful scenery with a tv budget, even if it's HBO.

EDIT: Davos is *perfect*. These guys should do the casting for every show, ever. I love his scenes almost as much as I enjoy Tyrion's and Arya's scenes. 

I'm going to have to rewatch this episode, as usual. Stannis and Melisandre still haven't clicked with me, yet.

Theon's scenes were awesome. I'm definitely more sympathetic to his plight, even though he's scummy at times. 

The conversation between Tyrion and Cersei was exceptional. Both actors giving noteworthy performances."
2,2,The Night Lands,"Whores, whores and tits every where"
2,2,The Night Lands,SNOWBALLING
2,2,The Night Lands,"Dat Balon

I now get a better sense of why [ACOK] (/b ""Theon goes crazy"") thanks to that scene."
2,2,The Night Lands,Kit Harington is really improving his acting this season. I don't like Jon much but his scene with Sam and Gilly was amazing! I haven't detected much derpface yet.
2,2,The Night Lands,Arya/Gendry/Hot Pie/Lommy scenes are the best ones (along with Tyrion).
2,2,The Night Lands,"They've never said Melisandre's name yet. I haven't read the books yet, if it wasn't for you guys, she'd be ""crazy witch lady"" to me. "
2,2,The Night Lands,Loving Gendry. 
2,2,The Night Lands,"Pyke looks so god damn awesome. In the intro, as well. But god every second Theon is on screen I just wish the closest character would slam his face into a pole or something."
2,2,The Night Lands,""" I'm not going rape her, I'm going to fuck her """
2,2,The Night Lands,Arya is becoming my new favorite character.
2,2,The Night Lands,[deleted]
2,2,The Night Lands,Gendry and Bronn.  My 2 new favorite characters after this episode.
2,2,The Night Lands,"I totally don't remember the Bloodriders and Irri [plus other handmaidens] having this much personality.
"
2,2,The Night Lands,I am glad that they are making Theon appear more outright sympathetic. Seeing the actual expressions on his face convey very clearly how conflicted he is. I always had felt sympathetic towards him even in the book because he is trapped between two worlds and belongs in neither. Also having an overbearing hard to impress father can drive you to do extreme things. Overall he is one of my favorite characters from the book because his chapters are so damn interesting. His internal conflict is really engaging. 
2,2,The Night Lands,"Honestly i expected Rorge to not have a nose, and Biter to look a bit more like Baraka from Mortal Kombat."
2,2,The Night Lands,"For the night is dark, and full of titties- er, I mean, terrors."
2,2,The Night Lands,Does anyone else think that maybe Littlefinger is foreshadowing Qyburn in his speech to Roz?
2,2,The Night Lands,Cersei-Tyrion exchange: best one of the series so far.
2,2,The Night Lands,"Just wanted to weigh in here:

Showing what Craster does with the kids, as opposed to the implication [SoS Spoiler](/b ""that comes in the books with what Gilly says about the boys to Jon and Samwell was unexpected but pretty cool. I'm always down to see more of the Others. I think it's way too hopeful to expect that we see the Fist of the First Men this season and what happens there, but I like that they are advancing that storyline."")

After I saw it, I realized that was one of those things that Benioff and Weiss said about ""Showing events that happen offscreen in the book, on screen in the TV show."" Very nice!

Also - Pyke was the shit and Balon was great. Jaqen was amazing. Cannot wait for the next episode. Asha/Yara...she isn't the brunette girl I envisioned, but she'll do.
"
2,2,The Night Lands,Way to go Sam! Abuse your relationship with Ghost to look like a badass in front of Gilly
2,2,The Night Lands,"Really looked like he was rubbing his sister's belly there.


Not sure if me gusta?"
2,2,The Night Lands,"One of the bloodriders dying was a surprise...why do you think did that?
"
2,2,The Night Lands,Officially scared shitless to find out what happens to Jon. You never know with this series your fav character can be killed! Anyone can be killed. Haven't read the second book yet hoping they keep Jon around lol
2,2,The Night Lands,"Seems Stannis not only has the personality of a lobster.. But also..

As hard as a ROCK lobster!!! *shot*"
2,2,The Night Lands,That ending was awesome.
2,2,The Night Lands,"The brothel sex scene was so unnecessary. 

I really liked Arya scenes however. Hot Pie was hilarious and Gendry was crazy charming. I started to be like ""hey... he doesn't find out her identity till the next book"" but by the end of the scene I was like ""NOT EVEN MAD, BRO"". 

Tyrion and Cersei? Fantastic scene."
2,2,The Night Lands,"Martin's worries about the ""butterfly effect"" echo throughout this whole freaking episode. Rakharo is dead (I guess the other two new kos can take his place in the plot), and Selyse is apparently bed-ridden and childless. Hopefully neither of those end up biting the show in the ass.

EDIT: mixed up names."
2,2,The Night Lands,DEM TEETH.
2,2,The Night Lands,Is it just me or did Theon look like a munchkin from Oz in all of that finery?
2,2,The Night Lands,Anyone else love the hell out of Stannis' table?
2,2,The Night Lands,Theon LOL!
2,2,The Night Lands,What happened in in the last scene?  All I could see was blackness.
2,2,The Night Lands,Ow.... little ships.. ><
2,2,The Night Lands,Tyrion is so fucking badass.
2,2,The Night Lands,"I'm really impressed with how details about Cersei's past can create sympathy and understanding for her character without excusing her behavior.

The first time I noticed this was in Season One when she explained how Robert called out ""Lyanna!"" the first time they had sex. The example I'm thinking of in this episode is obviously the conversation between her and Tyrion in which we find out that their mother died in labor. 

It really demonstrates the skill of the writers for an audience to *completely* understand why a character like Cersei acts so reprehensibly while at the same time allowing her to remain contemptible."
2,2,The Night Lands,"I think just how quickly Stannis decided to fuck Mel did a disservice to his character.

 [Book Spoilers](/b ""Also I gleaned from the books it wasn't for passion or sons he fucked her, it was so she could use him for her spells.Wasn't there a line later on about how what they were doing wasn't going to work anymore because she used him up? Stannis's pragmatism and his honor intermingle in a very interesting way. They could have had him protest a little harder. I only saw it happening after the meeting with Renly and it being his last chance at getting Renly's men and winning the crown. Him having sex with her was a war decision. I can see Stannis ordering an assassination, but I don't see Stannis wanting a bastard son."")"
2,2,The Night Lands,"Two episodes in and still no Brienne or Margaery . :( I can't wait until episode three, I'm really looking forward to the Cat/Brienne/Renly  etc storyline!"
2,2,The Night Lands,The Littlefinger/Ros scene was fantastically done.
2,2,The Night Lands,"They still didn't say Mel's name. I wonder if she'll be just ""The Red Priestess"" forever."
2,2,The Night Lands,"In the scene where the small council meets, there was a tapestry in the background depicting two mounted combatants fighting next to a river. Interesting..."
2,2,The Night Lands,"All this extra sex that isn't in the books is just getting fucking stupid, to be honest.  The book had enough sex to meet HBO's quota, easily.  Now, they're just using up valuable screen time for little exposition.  As a fan of the books, it's frustrating.  They could use these precious minutes to fit in more valuable dialogue, backstory...but it's just sex, sex, sex even when it wasn't in the books.  Doesn't add anything."
2,2,The Night Lands,I think Asha/Yara was cast perfectly.  I don't get the hate.
2,2,The Night Lands,"When they listed the actors for Season 2 and Salla wasn't included, I was afraid they were going to write him out of the show. That said, I'm really enjoying how he was portrayed. Personally, I pictured him looking almost like Jafar from Aladdin, but the character fits perfectly."
2,2,The Night Lands,"The scene with Tyrion and Janos Slynt was so awesome! Tyrion's delivery of ""I'm not insulting your honour; I'm denying it's very existence!"" was BRILLIANT!!!  Easily my favorite line of this episode.  Also the Ayra/Gendry storyline is shaping up quite well indeed. Jaqen's line's about needing a drink are spot on perfect iMo.  Anybody else notice Biter's teeth???? pointy pointy "
2,2,The Night Lands,"Late to the party, and it may just be the book reader in me, but daaaaaaaamn!  Maybe my favorite episode to date, which says a lot."
2,2,The Night Lands,"Stannis went from ""nope"" to ""let's fuck on Westeros"" pretty quickly. On another note, the casting for both Stannis and Davos is perfect. "
2,2,The Night Lands,The only thing I disliked about the episode was the whole brothel scene. Not just the unnecessary sex scenes but the whole dialogue by Littlefinger too. Danys story is dragging a little as well. I loved the Mel/Stannis sex scene and can't wait for future scenes of her and Davos. 
2,2,The Night Lands,Cercei attempting to come back at Tyrion when he makes the comment about Jamie coming down on her repeatedly really just shows how desperate she is. People often try to cut you with the deepest insult possible when they feel truly vulnerable. This scene is perfect because it just shows just how hopeless she feels
2,2,The Night Lands,The actress who plays Asha(Yara) is not at all how I pictured her. Everything else in this episode was golden.
2,2,The Night Lands,"To be honest, I haven't even seen past the 9th episode of the first season =["
2,2,The Night Lands,Ok. Why do I not remember Melisandre and Stannis Banging in Clash?
2,2,The Night Lands,"Im just reading book three and I am at the part where its kinda revealed what craster has been doing with his sons... and now hbo has shown jon snow pretty much finding out what craster does, and craster has caught him... am I wrong in thinking this is kind of a big reveal in the books that has come much too early? "
2,2,The Night Lands,"Anyone notice the [Book Spoiler](/b ""blackwater chain sigil next to the name of the actor who plays bronn?"") Awesome attention to detail. "
2,2,The Night Lands,"In terms of story adaption, this is the best episode of the season. They dealt with several subtle and complex plot points very deftly. Although so many things were covered, none of the scenes felt rushed. I don't know who wrote this episode (was it GRRM himself?) but he/she did an awesome job. As a very nitpicky fan of the book, I give this an A+."
2,2,The Night Lands,I think some of the time they're devoting to all the gratuitous sex can be devoted to more important parts of the storyline...
2,2,The Night Lands,Definitely crossed over into full blown porn territory this episode.
2,2,The Night Lands,"Lots of awkward sex scenes.

The incest fingerbang on the horse was weird as hell."
2,2,The Night Lands,"With all the big changes including the cliffhanger at the end that wasn't in the books at all, anyone else see the series going more of a 'Dexter' route where the first season stuck close to books, but then veered way off course in later seasons? I can see them loosely sticking to the story, however beginning to stray more and more from the books. "
2,2,The Night Lands,"Why hasn't Dany arrived at the awesome blue (blue in my mind) place with the peaches and the not death and dying? Didn't she arrive there in the books before any of the bloodriders got back? Also I can't believe they killed Rakharo.

Still, I like Bronn being Captain of the Guard."
2,2,The Night Lands,"Arya and Gendry!! I loved them so much, excited for more of there storyline"
2,2,The Night Lands,"I loved the Varys/Baelish dick waving contests from the first season.

Now I get Tyrion/Varys/Baelish dick waving contests? Dear God I'm in Heaven."
2,2,The Night Lands,"Stannis-fan here. I didnt like that Stannis and Mel's relationship was made explicit. Its implied obviously, but the truth of the rumor that Stannis and Mel are getting it on is inherently linked to Stannis' integrity. 

Basicly if you take the entirety of Stannis' story arc through all 5 books: with him porking Mel, and without - the overall images are quite different. How ensnared in Mel's religion is he? How ""honorable"" is he really?

If in GRRM's own head, Stannis and Mel were doing the nasty, then I think it was made explicit far far too early (like books/seasons too early). If in GRRM's head they WERENT, then HBO hypersexualized things at the expense of characterization. 

I like to think Stannis is not a hypocrit. I think it would have been very dramatic (and a brilliant contrast to the rest of the sex in the show) if Stannis had resisted Mel. The sexual-tension was great, Mel the seductress was great, but imagine how intense it would have been if Stannis had stuck to his guns and stormed-out or something. Even just for a single episode would have built Stannis' character enormously."
2,2,The Night Lands,"Yara!? Yara!? ....duh fuck, I want Asha"
2,2,The Night Lands,"Upcoming speculation from someone who hasn't read ACOK.

I got a really terrible vibe from the way Matthos looked at his father after Melisandre whispered that thing about fire. I assume that he's going to be convinced into trying to kill Davos (with fire!) by Melisandre. 

I really like his character, he pulls off the whole young man who believes too vehemently in something and wants everyone else to, especially the man he loves the most in his father. And he's willing to ""save"" his father by any means necessary. Chills. Very good acting."
2,2,The Night Lands,"Gotta be brutally honest ... one of my least favorite episodes.

edit: It was better the 2nd viewing, but still very scattered with relatively little development. While I *have* read the books, I try to watch it from a ""what would a casual non-reader fan think?"" point of view... and from that perspective I would be lost, yet still feel like nothing really happened."
2,2,The Night Lands,i REALLY miss Sean Bean :/ 
2,2,The Night Lands,"Apparently according to a test group who were shown the first four episodes, this one was rated the worst. 

So we're going to get our faces blown off next week, basically. "
2,2,The Night Lands,"They're really departing from the books in places. I really have to put my book knowledge in the back of my mind [Book Spoiler](/b ""at least they got the Asha flirting part pretty well that was too funny not to put in"")"
2,2,The Night Lands,"Does anyone else think they elevated Bronn to the head of the city watch to avoid introducing [Book Spoiler](/b ""Lollys and her rape?"") 

[TV Spoiler](/s ""The previews have shown that the riot with the royal entourage is going to happen"") - but [Book Spoiler](/b ""having a fairly minor, mentally-disabled character get sexually assaulted and end up with a child"") seems extreme even for this show.

And it's a really minor event until [Book Spoiler](/b ""Bronn marries her and takes her lands"")...

[Book Spoiler](/b ""If you get rid of Lollys, you get rid of her entire family"") and that's a significant amount of time you get freed up in the show. "
2,2,The Night Lands,"With Bronn promoted to the commander of the gold cloaks, I fear he will be lost to us."
2,2,The Night Lands,"I didn't know how I felt about Stannis last week, but I feel he was cast really well. Despite the whole him/Melisandre thing, he comes across exactly as I pictured him."
2,2,The Night Lands,"When Melisandre said to Stannis that his wife only gave him death, were the hell was Shireen? Is she being written out?
"
2,2,The Night Lands,"Question,  I'm a little confused on how Tyrion was able to get guards to grab Janos Slynt and exile him the wall like that?  Were the guards being loyal to the Hand of the King (ie following the chain of command) or were they being loyal to Tyrion?   I'm asking because Ed Stark was also the Head of the King and yet none of them thought twice when Janos ordered them to kill Ed Starks' people and arrest him. 

I guess I'm more confused by this whole hierarchy thing or how this game gets played."
2,2,The Night Lands,"So, did the younger Maester of Dragonstone get replaced with Davos' son? And did Mel give said son [Book Spoiler](/b ""a glimpse of what goes down on the blackwater"")
? "
2,2,The Night Lands,"While watching that scene where Littlefinger is trying to ""console"" Ros, all I could think about was [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rxCZ7c-AO4).  

The background may be different but the overall message is the same.

"
2,2,The Night Lands,"Dat cliffhanger, FML."
2,2,The Night Lands,Was it just me or does the intro sound like it was a half step higher than the previous intros?
2,2,The Night Lands,[deleted]
2,2,The Night Lands,Anybody else notice that Davos has both sets of fingers yet he carries the bag (containing his fingers from his left hand) around his neck?
2,2,The Night Lands,"Seriously? The best line they can give Dolorous Edd is a fart joke? 

God they're butchering his character."
2,2,The Night Lands,"Some of the casting on this show is perfect (Davos, Joffrey, Cersei, etc.)  
But did anyone else think Asha (why did they call her Yara?) and Melisandre could've been better cast?  "
2,2,The Night Lands,"Is this porn??

Dad dixit. "
2,2,The Night Lands,This was the first episode that as a viewer who has read all the books I had a very hard time with. Just so many liberties were taken and some of them were just unexplainable. Anyone else feel the same way?
2,2,The Night Lands,"I'm just not really into this season. Maybe the pacing is off without Sean Bean, or there's just too much to condense, I'm not sure.

And I'm not sure what to make of this version of Cersei. I hate the book version, and initially enjoyed enjoyed the HBO revisions to her character, but she seems like more of a sympathetic hostage to her son than the scheming, power hungry ball of insanity that she is."
2,2,The Night Lands,"That ending bolstered my theory that [spec](/g ""Craster's sons are raised into White Walkers"")"
2,2,The Night Lands,"What the fuck did I just watch?

So much sex all the alterations..."
2,2,The Night Lands,Was anyone else really grossed out by the captain's daughter's tits?
2,2,The Night Lands,way too much sex in this episode for my liking
2,2,The Night Lands,No Hodor. :(
2,2,The Night Lands,The lack of Sansa in this episode was awesome.
2,2,The Night Lands,Overall: other than Tyrion/Cersei... can't say I was terribly impressed with this ep.
2,2,The Night Lands,"So with Tyrion making Bronn city commander instead of Bywater I'm really curious to see how it's going to play out.  [Book Spoiler](/b ""In the books it's Bywater and he dies during the siege, while Bronn lives on without any real purpose but to ""betray"" Tyrion and refuse to fight for him.  Do you think that they plan on having Bronn die kind of as a way to remove another character going into Season 3?"")"
2,2,The Night Lands,"tonight's episode had it's moments both good and bad. Yoren's scene along with the development between Arya and Gendry were brilliant. The dialogue between Tyrion and Cersei was outstanding. I do agree that there was absolutely too many sex scenes. they could be focusing on much more important aspects of the series with that screen time. The death of Rakkharo confuses me, but the acting in that scene was brilliant. The show seems to be taking more liberties with the story than i would like, but in the end, it's nothing incredibly significant.
"
2,2,The Night Lands,Solitude!
2,2,The Night Lands,Suspenseful ending.
2,2,The Night Lands,"Where did the whole Craster attacking John come from? That never happened in the books right? 

Also, it wasen't Gillys baby given to the Other in the book. "
2,2,The Night Lands,carice van Houten made me  O.O
2,2,The Night Lands,Fucking Theon man!
2,2,The Night Lands,"I don't remember Stannis banging Melissandre in the book. Was that implied and I missed it, or what? 

I'd have thought Stannis was stronger than that. "
2,2,The Night Lands,"What was the guys name who said to Arya ""A boy could make a friend."" The guy who was in the cage with two other men in the beginning?

Is he a major character?

**Edit:** Never mind, it was Jaqen"
2,2,The Night Lands,can someone please tell me what was the point of rakharo dying. i mean it wasn't in the books and i didn't really see the point of it.(also the part when the dothraki lady screamed was pretty bad)
2,2,The Night Lands,"I seem to be the only one who is upset about how the changed the scene where Tyrion confronts Cersei about her incest from the book [COK Spoiler](/b ""in the book when he confronts her about her affair with Jamie he states that he's known about it for years"") while in the show he hears it from Stanis like everyone else.  It takes away from the idea the Tyrion is supposed to be the smartest guy in the room yet he doesn't notice that is own siblings have been doing it for years "
2,2,The Night Lands,"I have no idea why they kept the scene with Theon and the random boat bitch. It was totally pointless, it offered completely nothing. And they spent like 5 minutes on Petyr and Roz, waste of time to be honest."
2,2,The Night Lands,"Who do you think will replace Rakharo's roles in the series since he died so early? 

[Book Spoiler](/b ""Rakharo doesn't die"")"
2,2,The Night Lands,Did anybody else think that Cersei looked just like Keira Knightley when she was talking to Tyrion in tonights episode?
2,2,The Night Lands,"Ok some things i find a little annoying about this season so far. Why is Gendry find about Ayra so fast i remember that happening so much later, if  correctly it was in ASOS or end of ACOK. Also since when is Bronn the commander of the City's watch? Plus what other people have been saying, HBO not being subtle, with the Stannis/Mel thing and the Craster and the others connection. It was ok with Renly in the first season cause it's renly and he wasn't important in the book, had to build him up to be in season two."
2,2,The Night Lands,"I was coming up on acid while watching this episode (watched the webrip on Monday). Shit was intense! Especially considering it was my first time on acid.

The scene with the owner of the brothel (can't remember his name) giving the whore the speech about his friend and how she didn't make him money... fucking ominous. Haha. Great episode. I love Tyrion, he's probably my favorite character."
2,2,The Night Lands,"They just ruined Tyrion's scene with regards to the Night's Watch. Won't matter in the long run, of course, but in the books, it was a nice glimpse into Tyrion's personality. He isn't perfect."
2,2,The Night Lands,Holy cow! Gilly is Cassie from Skins? And Chris is The Bull? This is awesome.
2,2,The Night Lands,Why the hell did they change it to make Bronn the new head of the gold cloaks?
2,2,The Night Lands,"finally I get to vent: these added scenes are just horrible, and the porn, dont like that I have to skip half of the episode filled with garbage.  
and Sam isnt supposed to be some horny teenager, like hell he would act like that, but be too scared even to think about girls.  
oh and killing off the bloodrider scene was just HORRIBLE, going for cheap soap-like emotions now, wtf?"
2,2,The Night Lands,"Stannis would never, never, fuck Melisandre! It goes against a central tenant of his character! What the fuck, he's supposed to be the guy that follows the rules to a fault, even if it means doing something thats terrible!"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I couldn't have expected any more from the actor who played Yoren. 
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Holy shit, that scene where Tyrion is figuring out who the spy is had some excellent editing."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Looks like Renly's got a new beard: both figuratively and literally!
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Looks like we won't be getting any Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie, Lommy wilderness adventures. At leat we got ""I yield."""
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,They should have thrown Theon in the ocean and revived him. What a scene that would be.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"""I'm not fond of crossbows...""

Best moment, in my opinion."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,That was probably the most awkward dinner at the beginning with Sansa and the Lannisters
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,[deleted]
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Wow, they're really making me feel sorry for Theon. He stated his case very eloquently there.

One ship to fight fishermen. Thanks for that vote of confidence, dad, sis."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Take a shot every time you don't know who has Harrenhal at the moment.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,[removed]
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Am I the only one who absolutely loves Brienne's armor? It might be my favorite in the show so far.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Yoren's watch has ended. Rest well, brother."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I love it when Tyrion is devious.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I had a great loud laught the moment tyrion put the second coin to that whore.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"The first two episodes were good, but they were mostly aftermath of season 1, setting things up for this season and introducing new characters.

This is the one where some real shit is starting to get down! Can't wait!"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Tyrion's ""Myrcella"" scene with Pycelle/Varys/Littlefinger was extremely well done.  "
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"[Here is Theon's letter to Robb, reversed so that it's readable](http://i.imgur.com/h1pVD.jpg).

Edit, transcript:
>Robb,  
>I hope this reaches you in time. My father has rejected your offer and plans to attack the North, raiding the shores and taking Deepwood Motte. Mobilize your army and make for the North before it's too late. I'll write again when I can.

>– Theon

I think the contents makes the betrayal of Robb's trust a bit more touching as a complex conflict for Theon."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"We have finally witnessed Hodor's first ""Hodor"" of the new season. It's been too long."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I knew it was gonna happen, but still NOOOO Yoren."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell is SO FINE
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Yoren is just too great.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,this was my favorite episode of the season so far... *by* far
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,FEEL BALON'S MASTERFUL PIMP HAND!!!
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I'm digging Yoren's style. Can't sleep? Have some wine. 
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Quick thinking Arya! Well done! *golf clap*

(haven't read books)"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I fucking loved that shot of Theon burning the letter.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,The Bran scenes are so interesting to me.  I wonder how TV viewers feel about them?
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Da fuck is up with Littlefinger's accent? 
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"* OMG dat Brienne, she was PERFECT. She absolutely towered over Catelyn, her tourney scene was great, and her and Renly's interaction was great.
* Loved the Loras/Marg/Renly scenes, I was so worried that they'd downplay Renly and Loras, but it was done perfectly. ""We can invite Loras if you want!""
* This episode actually made me feel for Theon, unlike in the books when I just wrote him off as the biggest douche to ever douche, the burning of the letter was great.
* Tyrion's scene with Varys/Littlefinger/Pycelle was awesomely edited.
* Loved Yoren's story about his brother, and he went down fighting like a badass.


Best episode of the season so far, imo. Although I'll admit the Sam/Gilly scene seemed to drag just a little for me."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I guess they didn't want to burn down a barn/stables. 
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"HOLY SHITBALLS, A SEX SCENE THAT ISN'T OVER THE TOP AND WHOLLY FITS, ADVANCES CHARACTER AND PLOT DEVELOPMENT!

Great episode.  Continually blown away by the casting and performances.  Gwendoline Christie's introduction was perfect.  Big thoughts this episode were that Alfie Allen's performance makes Theon 1000x more sympathetic than he comes off in the books, and Sophie Turner is really terrific as Sansa, really makes you feel her anguish and the difficulty of her situation.

Reading the books, I just thought Theon was a dick who turned too easily.  It seems a lot more natural given Allen's performance, honestly."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Does Tyrion's whore become a useful character in the books? Because I cannot stand her at all.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I really like how they introduced the prayer; a great example of a creative liberty taken that improves the show. Theon's stuff was perfect as well.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Interesting to see how they cut Arya's storyline, but I suppose they didn't take out anything extremely important anyway. Except one of my favorite Arya lines about yielding! Can't wait for Jaqen H'ghar scenes."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,For the night is dark and full of boobies.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery is showing off the goods.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,[deleted]
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Loras is just mad that Brienne will make the Rainbow Guard less fabulous. 
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"A lot of smart moves on D&D's part this episode: Theon's internal conflict is super clear on-screen, the Great Ranging has this theatrical sense of drama and urgence, Amory helps place Arya in Harrenhal rather than having that long-winded wandering sequence that works on paper but not within ten hours of TV, and (holy shit) Tyrion's scenes have not skimped on the political badassery from the books.

Also, calling it right now: since the Bloody Mummers were cut (for now), but Gregor is recast, Gregor's torturers and psychopaths are either holding Harrenhal or following Lorch's crew. Lots of great plot consolidation in general."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I was laughing through the whole Renly scene. So painful to watch, not his portion with Loras, but rather with Margaery."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I think that's the first time i've ever seen a youth actually killed on screen. (lommy greenhands)
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Yoren went down like a boss. Sad there was no ""HOT PIE!"" though."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"[ASOS Spoilers](/b ""Wait, they cut Arya and company escaping into the woods? Does that mean they cut out Tickler? I swear I will be so upset if Arya doesn't get to say 'Is there gold in the village?'"")"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Anyone else picture Tommen to be a little fatter? 
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I actually felt something that wasn't revulsion for Cersei this episode.

Lena Headey played that scene where she found out about Myrcella beautifully.  You could like feel her motherly anguish beaming out of the damn TV."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Pycelle's scene? Handled Brilliantly!

Shagga's line. The beard. Tyrion paying the whore. Perfect. So absolutely perfect."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Awwwwwww Samwell is fucking adorable, i love him more now!"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Ok I want a whole series just for Varys and Tyrion where they can do anything, fight crime, rule the world, they're amazing together"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"> Brianne in the Kingsguard

I'm kind of glad they didn't do the whole Rainbow Guard thing, that would have been a bit too campy. Heavily implied fellatio is one thing, you don't need the gay character to fart rainbows and flap his wrists in a heavy handed gay stereotype sort of manner."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Tyrion's best episode, if you ask me. He was right, he actually does look weak with Shae, first time he didn't ooze with confidence. But the rest of the episode was business as usual."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Brienne was fucking huge. Like so huge. 

Also Theon's outburst was really emotional. Seriously, that was really well done. I felt so bad for Theon |

And they made people easier to sympathize with Sansa. That dinner scene

Also HBO, was that a tasteful sex scene I saw there? More of those please "
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I loved how they handled Renly's bedding of Margaery, so awkward and well done. Also how he just nonchalantly approved Briennes request, it made me lol. 

I did hate how they never had Hot Pie do his battle cry, but, eh, c'est la vie. Definitely a fantastic episode."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I'm really excited for this one. All of the reviewers who have seen the first 4 episodes have said this is when they really start getting good. 
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Poor Theon. [Book Spoiler/Speculation](/g ""You'd have probably been much happier with Robb than your father, RW and all."")"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"My thoughts (like anyone cares):
- There was no unnecessary sex scenes for once. The ones in episode 3 were more tasteful and actually advanced plot.
- Margaery is hotter than I remember in the books
- Yoren is the most depressing death in the whole series IMO, he was a goddamn hero"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,This just in: winter is coming.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,It was over too quickly!
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"if after this you still hate sansa, you are bad and you should feel bad. that is all. "
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,This episode better have Hot Pie. Lots of Hot Pie.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Oh hey, look! An episode with characters from the story, and sans a ten minute Ros scene! Brienne has been wonderfully cast, btw."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I'm hoping the introduction of Brienne is in this episode.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"A few thoughts:

1) The Yoren and Arya scene was incredible. What a great actor that guy was, I will miss him on the show. I had forgotten that he [CoK Spoiler](/b ""Was the inspiration for Arya's prayer"")

2) Was that Ser Amory Lorch on the horse that came up on the Night's Watch crew? I thought it was, and he announced himself as such, but he seemed to be wearing the armor that I see Gregor Clegane wearing in screenshots of upcoming episodes.

3) Who was the bald guy that killed Lommy - that's Raff the sweetling right?

4) Jaqen H'ghar - going to be amazing

5) Roose Bolton next week. Fuck yes!
"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Anybody else tear up while Yoren and Arya were talking?
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Did any of you feel that when Yoren was fighting the lannister guards that he looked like Ned, I mean with the hairstyle and all. Also the relentless fighting and the will never to give up (i.e. Jaime vs Ned season 1)."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,[removed]
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Just fyi if you have HBO Go on Xbox, episode 3 is up right now."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Thank god I didn't see Ros.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"What a great episode!  Once again, D&D&GRRM have really done a great job condensing certain things, adding interesting things, and translating other things almost exactly.  The way they handled Tyrion's Myrcella Gambit (1,2,3) was one of those moments that was uniquely cinematic for the series, yet also about as close as the way on the page as it could have been translated sensibly.


Yoren's fight sequence, brutal and badass.  Then the later brutality of Lommy being killed; slighty different from the books, but actually very fascinating and horrifying in the way that he used Needle, and also how quiet it was.  A slow insertion of a need, without any need for a splatty blood sound effect.  Brutal.



Solid episode.

"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Pyke always looks much more miserable than I imagined
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Anyone notice when Tyrion leaves Cersei after their little squabble that the camera angle makes him bigger than her? Very clever work I think.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"In all the badass-ness of the episode, I forgot entirely to mention how awesome Maester Luwin was in the episode. It's almost like he's become their surrogate mother/father. He's such a neat old man, I love him."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Isaac is too cute for words and a very good Bran.

2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Margaery Tyell is much more worldly and cunning than I imagined in the books, and it makes me really excited to see [Book Spoiler](/b ""scenes between her and Cersei Lannister, especially. "")"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Anyone else love the shot of Arya polishing Needle?  I'm loving all the little references to Ned with the kids.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Those Sansa scenes just about broke my heart.  I honestly had tears streaming down my face.  I'm a guy.  

Something about the way she was yelling as Shae made me feel the overwhelming loneliness of her situation.  Like all the frustration she feels finally comes tumbling out but in the end she can't even send her away."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"""I yield!"""
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Gendry was fighting like a badass! You could definitely see the Baratheon in him then.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Not a lot of plotlines were covered this episode. No Robb, no Stannis, No Daenerys...it was really mostly just Tyrion and a bit of Catelyn, Renly, Bran, Sansa, Arya and Jon.

EDIT: Actually, now that I think about it a lot of plotlines *were* covered, but it didn't feel like it. And still no Jojen/Meera."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Balon should give slapping lessons. 
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I can't decide if Tyrion's spy scene was better or Varys and Tyrion discussing the effects of the spy scene and the all famous power riddle.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Brienne is FUCKING HUGE
"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I have to express I have been kind of unsatisfied with the Greyjoy arcs thus far. Is Victarion written off entirely? Can we assume the Priest who blesses Theon was the Damphair, despite the lack of introduction? Or is it just some random priest?

I will admit I was really happy with some of the dialogue from Theon. [Book Spoiler](/b ""In the books, it's not til way later on that the reader learns of Theon's remorse about betraying the Starks."") The scene with him troubled over his letter and candle was touching. As was his dialogue with Balon about how it's his fault Theon grew up in Winterfell. 
"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I like this Margarey far more than the one in the book <3
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I still want more Bran!!
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Aww man! Hot Pie didn't yell ""Hot Pie!"" when they fought the Gold Cloaks. That was the funniest thing in the book. "
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I really liked the scene where Cersei reacts to Tyrion's decision to wed Myrcella to the house of Martell. Headey is a great actress!
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Margaery Tyrell: Queen of the Side Boob.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,And when I started liking Yoren they fucking killed him. Those bastards...
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,After watching this episode I realize that I would punch my grandmother in the face to have a copy of TWOW in my hands right now.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Can't wait for Brienne's tourney fight! And Renly/Loras/Marg! Just too stoked in general. 
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,[deleted]
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"So initial thoughts:

Littlefinger totally sounded like a pirate.

I've been pronouncing Margaery wrong this whole time.

Theon must have gotten smacked hard to fly back like that.

*""Matrimony... hrrrrrm.... yess.""*"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"One thing I realized about this episode is we were wrong about Ros taking the spot as [COK Spoiler](/b ""the whore who allows Tyrion access to Shae"") since Shae is now Sansa's handmaid. I really thought we had the right idea, Reddit."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Can't wait for more Jaqen!
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Ok so were Renly and Loras gay in the books? I've read them twice and can't remember that ever happening.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I loved how they did the scene with Yoren fighting. He was one of my favorite characters :'(

I also liked the scene when Tyrion gave the whore a second coin and you can just subtly understand that he's telling her to keep her silence."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Damn, these episodes feel shorter every week."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"* No Dany? Poo.
* Loved Yoren's talk with Arya about his prayer. I don't remember that part in the book but I love what it sets Arya up for. 
* Dayum Margery be fine.
* I never felt this sorry for Theon in the books as I do for him on the show. He doesn't  truly belong anywhere, poor guy. 
* Still not feeling Yara. I tried to give the actress a chance, but she still feels awkward. I wan't expecting her to be smokin' hot or anything, I picture Asha in the books to have some serious swagger and cockiness to her, and Yara is all hunched and derpy looking. 
* Needs moar Jaquen H'ghar. 
* Renly has a peach in the preview!"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I saw a screenshot of this, so I wonder if the [ACOK](/b "" scene with Yoren's group at Harrenhal is in this episode. If it is, I am prepared to cry manly tears for that crow."")"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Severely disappointed by the lack of Ros this week. I mean, they can't just leave us hanging like this! Did she satisfactorily mourn the dead baby? Were she and Littlefinger both happy! I NEED TO KNOW"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,OMG.  Brienne towers over people all most as much as the mountain.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I'm going to assume that they'll work in some Arya/Gendry/Hot Pie [ACOK](/b ""adventuring once they escape Harrenhal."")"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Pissed they didn't actually drown theon and then C.P.R. his ass.  Amazed at yoren's story, acting, and death.  That was the perfect, 'let's make everyone like goose, and then immediately kill him off right in front of maverick' sequence. "
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I wanna see Andy Samberg's SNL consultant-to-GRRM respond to the sex scenes in this episode.

Besides that, Yoren scene was the most badass since Syrio, Theon is portrayed as torn better than I ever could have hoped, and Tyrion is as amazing as ever."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"It hasn't started yet and already this episode is amazing!!!!

but no seriously, I heard great things about this episode. I'm stoked."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Definitely the best episode so far. 

Really liked the scene with Theon burning his letter. Can't wait to see how they handle [TV Spoiler](/s ""Littlefinger meeting up with Catelyn Stark."") "
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Still incredibly unimpressed by Yara. I seriously love every other new cast member but her. She's completely wooden in her acting and she has an incredibly plain look to match. I even think they did poorly in her outfit. I get that she isn't supposed to be flashy, but she's just lifeless and boring."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,53 minutes. Can't wait!
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,When will the episode be posted to HBO GO? 10:00 I'm guessing? 
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Does anybody know how quickly the show will be on HBO On Demand?
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"TIL I've been saying Brienne wrong. 

For some reason it wasn't brie-en but breen in my head"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Did the Tyrell flowers guy change actors since season 1?
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"""A shadow on the wall...""  What a great dialogue and great scene there!  Kinda disappointed we didn't see any Dany tonight though."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"This episode is my favorite so far.

That was soooooooo good.

Too bad for Yoren though."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,what the fuck happened to the rainbow guard?
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,The only thing that bothered me about this episode is that it wasn't longer! I want to see Stannis and Melisandre and more Renly and Margery. Why can't they just give us 2 hour episodes every week?
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"If I remember correctly Margaery is 16 in the books, but in the show she's played by a 30 year old, how old is she in the show?"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"SHAGGA! My roommate looked at me rather funnily during this episode because about every 5 minutues I expected Shagga to come out and the good Maester

Shagga Son of Dolf will Feed his Member to the Goats!"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Was Margaery out of breath that whole scene involving the skirmish and Catelyn breaking words with Renly? Her chest was moving pretty rapidly.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I swear this show moves so fast after you've read the book. I know the books are super long and they need to condense but damn I would not have expected to be so far in by ep 3.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Knowing Theon's future, [Book Spoiler](/b ""Greyjoy's words at the end ""What is dead may never die, but will rise again stronger"" can't remember exact words, is pretty chilling, while also hopeful."")"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"-Brienne is really well cast. She is freakishly tall (and big, but I guess that's mostly the armor) and nails the social awkwardness that covers Brienne (imo).

-Poor old Lommy, I knew he was gonna die but the scene still caught me by surprise. I believe it was Raff the sweetling that killed him? Motherfucker is stonecold.

I also thought the Cercei scenes were well done. Pretty much copied off the book if i recall correctly?"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Highlights of S2E3:
1) Tyrion's clever, clever outsmarting of the douches of the Small Council
2) Brien = badass, future role model for Arya? :-)
3) Margaery being totally down for a threesome if that's what it takes to get the baby-makin' job done!"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,This episode made me realize how quickly they're rushing through book content and how much is left out.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,If only I had hbo :/
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Renly and Margaery got married in between these past 2 episodes?

Side note: Me likey."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I was really fond of Loras for some reason. I had an instant liking to him.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,What time EST does the show start again? Is it 8 or 9?
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I always thought of the ""Drowning"" as a much MUCH more violent process. Also, I can't believe no one's asked, but I assume that was Aeron Greyjoy, correct?"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,H-OOOT PIE!
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"No Dany in this episode :( Not having read the books, I'm curious what happens, and I'm so worried for her!"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Tyrion acting apologetic to Littlefinger was a moment of acting brilliance i couldn't hold my laughter at all.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Great episode, although lacking Stannis/Daenerys. By the way, who would win in a sword fight: Syrio or Yoren?"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Question

[ACOK](/b ""Refresh me please, Gendry was not at Harrenhal right? I thought that he stays back at some inn and Arya goes there alone?"")"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Brienne is GIGANTIC!  Loved the size difference!  When I saw the preview pics of her I hadn't realized just how big she was, but after seeing her next to Catelyn I have to say that I am impressed with that casting choice."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Okay, sorry to ask an incredibly stupid question but what happened to the hill tribes? Last season Tyrion was all gung-ho about offering them the Vale but now we haven't seen anything of them this season. Are they still fighting with Tywin? Sorry but I just realized this now and it's been bothering me."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"If Raff the Sweetling was so chilling. Then the Tickler....""How many men? Is there gold in the village?"". Cant wait."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I think we had first mention of Martells in the series!
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Tyrion as usual stole the show. I don't know if anybody mentioned it, but after Pycelle is arrested and he gives the whore a coin ""for your troubles""... and then he gives her another one! Hahahah awesome."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"What music was used during the greyjoy ceremony?

So epic."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,They better not fuck up Victarion like they did Aeron. Come to think of it...did they cut Victarion from this season??
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Maybe I missed it, but was the Renly/Loras scene in the book? If so, I completely forgot about it."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Who can explain the note and what it said? and why he burned it?
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Arya's quick thinking when the Lannister guards asked about Gendry. Man, she is amazing."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,It's on HBO GO.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,hnnnnnnnnnnnng
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,what happened to Shagga guys? We didn't see his barber skills. Also Yoren fought very good. It was almost as good as Syrio's fight.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I was really disappointed in the fight at the end of the episode. Why didn't they they just follow the book? Running OUTSIDE of your fort is the worst thing you can do when you are besieged by a superior force like that!

2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Lommy's death was bad ass.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Sansa seemed taller.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Who is the actor pouring water on Theon?  I thought he looked a lot like Eomer (Karl Urban)
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Well, it wouldn't be game of thrones without me getting super pissed at the writers for killing off characters.


Haven't read the books, but hopefully no one else that cool gets killed this season."

2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,My only complain is there was not enough of 'Arry.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Was the tribesman Tryion brought to question Pycelle Timett? I'm asking because it looked like him, but he's been a featured extra in the previous episodes and haven't uttered a word."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Loras is a new actor, right? Also, I don't remember Renly and Loras having any gay scenes in the books. Am I wrong? "
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Did anyone else see Renly wink at Brienne in the beginning? I tried to search to see if someone else mentioned it; sorry if someone already brought it up.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"every new episode seems to provide more memorable quotes for the series, i feel like they stepped it up on a notch on the writing for the dialogues. "
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I missed Daenerys. The show opening was incorrect :/
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"This was my favourite episode of the season, and possibly of the series, so far. The first two felt a bit cluttered, and it was mostly just catch-up on where the characters are now. This episode, by contrast, actually felt like it had a narrative, and we were seeing important things progress. That's probably because we did not see Stannis, Dany, or Robb at all, which meant a lot more time to focus on what we did see."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"Love Lommys death, great to see a show not afraid to make controversial scenes such as deaths of children, also loved the Brienne fight and Renly looks so much better this season, HUGE lack of Stannis this episode tho"
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I am severely disappointed by how they handled the whole nights watch attack. :(

Edit: To clarify I'm referring to Yoren & his recruits."
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I just wish that Theon and the rest of his 'family' looked anything like each other.
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,I can't get over how Asha isn't nearly as attractive as I imagined in the books.

2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,[removed]
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"I think that the end was *masterfully* done, the bit about Gendry, Arya, Lommy and Hot Pie escaping alone wasn't that necessary, and I like that they're keeping the ""finding the bastard"" subplot consistent. Although I didn't think Arya needed to say ""He loved that helmet."" That seemed a tad silly.

On another note, **RAINBOW GUARD**! **RAINBOW GUARD**, NOT KNIGHTSGUARD! "
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,How come there are no comments about the arrow to the knee kid?
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Incoming arrow to the knee jokes in 3... 2... 1...
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,Anybody else upset they didn't drown Theon even for just a second?
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"So they kind of ruined the introduction of the ""Tickler"" and the Bloody Mummers IMO.  There is no drama or fear surrounding their characters as there was in the CoK.  Hot Pie does not get to yell ""HOT PIE,  HOT PIE!"" as Arya is screaming ""WINTERFELL!  WINTERFELL!"" giving a hint as to where her loyalties really lie...  Lots of missed opportunities for good character development. "
2,3,What Is Dead May Never Die,"best episode this season, though could have been better.  
they should have drowned Theon, sansa-shae scene was bit ackward and epmty, did we really need to know about yoren?, who really wants to see renly loras?"

2,4,Garden of Bones,"Man... Joffrey's sex life, Bolton talking about flaying, the Tickler, Melisandre's shadow baby... this episode was *extremely* unsettling (in a good way? I can't decide).

By far the worst part for me was the torture at Harrenhal.  I almost lost my dinner when I realized where that rat was trying to escape to.  They didn't even have to show it; the implication of it (and the screaming) was enough for me.  Damn HBO is good..."
2,4,Garden of Bones,Xaro is one smooth motherfucker.
2,4,Garden of Bones,I'm enjoying the casting of Renly much more than I expected. He's capturing the casual charisma of Renly quite well.

2,4,Garden of Bones,"Some interesting developments in the episode. The shadow birthing scene was...*interesting*. When I read that part, I knew it would look weird as hell on a tv screen; lo and behold, it was pretty weird. I think my friend summed it up nicely with:

2,4,Garden of Bones,Stannis is going to be pissed when he sees that that baby is black!
2,4,Garden of Bones,Finally a bit of Grey Wind in action.

2,4,Garden of Bones,The worst part of that episode was trying to explain to my non-book friends and family why the pale man talking about flaying people is my favorite character...
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I loved seeing Daenerys fumble for her speech a little bit when she met the Thirteen. Not too much, but just enough to show that she's not practiced in communicating like a queen (to non-Dothraki, at any rate)."

2,4,Garden of Bones,Dig the soundtrack especially the track that follows Stannis gives me chills 
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I was watching the show at a bar (got to love NYC ) and that ending totally gave away who had read the book and who had not. Everyone who had read the books were full of anticipation, and after the birth the non -reader's were all like what the hell was that.

"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Congratulations, it's a _______ !?!"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Thoughts on tonight's episode:

1 - Loved seeing Roose Bolton finally, and he looks totally badass

2 - Couldn't catch Jeyne's changed name in the show, but I thought she was very attractive

3 - Melisandre scene - awesome

4 - It's getting redundant, but Tyrion was once again absolutely incredible on the show

5 - Is there gold in the village? Where's the Brotherhood? SO glad they kept the Tickler in. Thought they would take him out but now I remember the casting announcement

6 - Charles Dance seems to be a pretty tall guy - he didn't look that much shorter than the Mountain. Tywin Lannister is a commanding presence

Can't wait for next week's episode. Jaqen, Jaqen, Jaqen"

2,4,Garden of Bones,"""For my vagina is dark and full of terrors."""
2,4,Garden of Bones,"My only complaint is that I think they're making Joffrey too much like [ADWD](/b ""Ramsay Bolton."") I know it's to color his personality for the viewers, but still."
2,4,Garden of Bones,Harrenhall was portrayed better than I could have imagined it 
2,4,Garden of Bones,I love the actor who plays Lancel. He's the perfect little chickenshit who thinks he's awesome now that he got knighted. He was also hilarious in season 1.
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Not at all what I imagined but goddamn, they did a good job with that [ACOK Spoiler](/b ""Shadow Assasin""). Every time they use CGI I'm astounded at how well it turns out.

Also, goddamn you Greg Spence."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I just want to say, bravo actress who portrays Catelyn. She did an amazing job. I teared up a little."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I loved the exchange between Littlefinger and Margaery. Some of his lines were so clever. For example, ""The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."" He delivered it so subtly that I didn't notice until I rewatched the scene."
2,4,Garden of Bones,So... Robb gets off at women chopping legs up.
2,4,Garden of Bones,What is up with Davos' rowboat that doesn't go anywhere?
2,4,Garden of Bones,not a fan of that scrawny version of the Mountain

2,4,Garden of Bones,"The end of the scene with Cat and Littlefinger was really touching, and that's saying a lot, because I really dislike Catelyn. "
2,4,Garden of Bones,NO PEACH!!!

2,4,Garden of Bones,"What was Daenerys thinking? There's only one city for hundreds of miles and she threatens to burn them down? I get that she maybe didn't want to show her dragons because they were small or whatever, but if they fit in those crates then that would be pretty obvious anyways."
2,4,Garden of Bones,There had better be some more Bran in this episode.
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Once again, the casting in this show is proving to be fantastic. Jeyne, Bolton, Jaqen, THE TICKLER, *jesus*, these casting agents are magicians.

EDIT: Okay, Xaro might be a bit stiff."
2,4,Garden of Bones,Also - Harrenhal looked BADASS
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Also, I loved how childish Daenerys seemed when she was trying to get into Qarth. I mean, she kept glancing back at Jorah like she was asking for his approval/agreement. It was cute. I think it was a wonderful way of showing that even though she's over-gone so many changes/hardships, she's still young and has a long way to go. And it shows that just because she has dragons, doesn't mean that everyone will magically bow to her will, especially when the dragons are so small and relatively easy to kill at this stage in life (in comparison to when they're full grown)."
2,4,Garden of Bones,My favorite quote this evening was from Davos: “This is so fucked up this is so fucked up this is so fucked up this is so fucked up this is so fucked up…”
2,4,Garden of Bones,"SOOOOO

Why were Pyke and Winterfell in the intro when there were no scenes that took place there?............................

They also didn't establish that Davos was taking Melisandre under [ACOK](/b ""Storm's End"")...unless he took her underneath [Speculation](/g "" Renly's camp"")...for the sake of shortening everything."
2,4,Garden of Bones,Arya becomes Tywin's cupbearer... for those who have read the books... wtf?
2,4,Garden of Bones,And I thought Joffery shooting cats in the book was much holy shit.
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Who was the chick Robb talked to near the beginning?  (the one who cut off the dude's leg)  
Can't be [Book spoiler](/b ""Jeyne Westerling"") can it? "
2,4,Garden of Bones,Really getting frustrated with 50 minute episodes. It wasn't like this last season. How do they justify cutting 10 minutes out of every episode then claim they can't fit everything into 10 episodes? Just so we can watch more commercials for HBO shows?
2,4,Garden of Bones,Holy shit that birth scene was insane!!
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Excellent episode. The first two felt more like extensions of the first series, the last two - this one in particular - feel far more distinct.

I think the show is stronger when the focus of the episode is on fewer characters"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"HBO is having to create scenes to progress the book in the show (EG. Littlfinger+Cat in this weeks episode).  I was concerned on how this would happen - but they did it brilliantly.  Littlefinger on his diplomatic mission to Renly's camp, all while serving himself and showing his ulterior motives.  I think HBO is doing a damn good job so far -- especially with Bronn's dialogue, Tyrion being a boss, epic camera angles emphasizing how baller Tywin Lannister is, rounding out with a ""Hate Joffrey More Now"" scene, complete with a Baratheon-themed, antler-ended this-looks-like-a-dildo-bat.  That being said, bring in the Reeds."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"""There's no cure for being a cunt"" - I think Bronn should have a catchphrase like this every week."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"My roommate ""That's the weirdest quif I've ever seen"""

2,4,Garden of Bones,aaaaaaand the shadowbaby rises...
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Whoaaa, the shadow birth was exactly how I pictured it.

This episode scared the shit out of me, and I knew what was coming.  Very excellent."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"""The night is dark and full of terrors"" i just loved how she said that to renly."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I have to say I've been a little disappointed by the first three episodes this season (just a little, I know there's a ton of exposition to get through), but this episode was amazing.  "
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Anyone else really miss the Peach in the Stannis/Renly excahnge?

Its a small detail, and doesn't do much to change my opinion on that great episode, but [ACOK/ASOS Spoiler](/b ""Stannis' confession to Davos about it was one my favourite parts of the books."") "
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I don't know if anybody else has said it, but so far in my opinion this is the best episode of the series. Every episode before it there was something, just something that I was displeased about. This episode... Nope, nothing. Literally every second I was prancing around like a school girl on coke. Fucking a, man, fucking a.

First we have the epic Greywind massacre of those Lannister soldiers. Those 2 scenes serve a great purpose that I wish more shows did. Rather than keeping on with this idea that all of Lannister men are faceless storm troopers, we see that they are humans. There is literally no difference between them and any other bannermen. It also did a fantastic job introducing Jeyne (who would have thought Charlie Chaplins granddaughter would have been such a fox, to boot), as well as giving us our first real meeting with Roose, really high lighting his coldness.

Then we have the Kings Landing events. Well sweet baby Jesus, I don't know where to begin. Just everything about those scenes were perfect. The subtle camera pan to the Hounds reaction to the stripping of Sansa. Tyrions blatant disregard for Joff's instructions. Bronn being just a badass in general. The Hound giving Sansa his cloak, and then her continuing to play face with Tyrion (I hadn't realized it while reading, but even now Sansa is clearly showing a talent in playing the game). Then the scene in Joffs room... Oh my, that was just perfect. It's one of those scenes the book so sorely lacked, a real look at what kind of shit this monster was into. Just perfect. And then, the piece de resistance. Tyrions subjugation of Lancel. Just brilliant. If you hadn't realized it by now, Tyrion is a true professional. Its one of the things I definitely think he inherited from his father (erhem *cough* Tywin is his father *cough* conspiracy theories be damned *cough*). Again, just perfect scenes.

Now for Qarth. Not really much to say here. In the grand scheme this is only a small part of the episode. They did a great job at really bringing Dany's power to the forefront. I'm also liking Xaro as well, glad they explained away his... Differing complexion. Even now you can see his scheming. Oh, I also like how they gave us just the briefest taste of the inside of the city, that was well done.

And now for Harrenhall (you'll notice I'm saving the Stormlands for last). First of all, I love how they designed it. I know in my head I imagined the castle still being mostly intact, but I like how they did it more. The liquidity of the stone was a nice touch, too. We also finally get to hear Arya's prayer, which is as appealing to the ears as it was to the eyes while reading. The torture scenes were handled perfectly, and I loved Hot Pie in it. They did such a good job I actually forgot for a moment whether Gendry survives Harrenhall, and was seriously worried. But of course, just at the last moment, MOTHERFUCKING TYWIN LANNISTER. I'll be the first to say, I despise the Lannisters. But god damn, if you can't see just how golden (heh) the Tywin character is, then you're blind. It's just such a well written, perfectly fleshed out character. Lttlefinger, the Eunuch, and himself are just in a league of their own when it comes to how smart they are, and then by extension how good at the game they are. That moment when he just starts ripping the Mountains men apart, oh god it was like music to my ears. ""Well of course not, because this boy is actually a girl."" oh man (and since Arya is by far my favorite character (hey, the homicidal little girls appeal to me, it's the same reason why I love Babette in Skyrim), his complement to her just sent me through the roof). And then the look he gives them when Gendry says he's a smith... Just priceless. I'm sorry, but just from a sheer comedy standpoint the Harrenhall scenes were perfect. 

And now, the Stormlands. SO much happened. First of all Gethin Anthony is just brilliant. I take back anything I said about him last season. He is just the embodiment of Renly. As for what happened, I think it all speaks for itself. The Stannis-Renly pissing contest. Cat meeting Littlefinger. Littlefingers conversation with Margery. It's all just so well written. I don't want this to drag on, so I'll leave those bits at that. However there's still one more part... The Shadow Baby. Oh god... That was brilliant. I never really knew how to picture it in my head, and sort of just pictured a full bodied shadow of a man. But this version... Oh wow. Wow wow wow. It is creepy, disgusting, and just perfect. When you see it moving around in the womb... ugh, shivers man. Davos' face during the whole ordeal was just perfect to boot. God, it was just... Art. 

Wow, that was a lot longer than I had thought. But yeah, best episode of the series yet imo."
2,4,Garden of Bones,God I hate Joffrey...
2,4,Garden of Bones,"So what were the scenes not in the book?  I can't recall exactly, and it
s been a while. 

So far, the whole Jeoffry beating whores seems added.  The Tyrion scene of setting up a spy I'm not certain off.  The straight to Harrenhall Arya thing is new (time saver really, I ain't mad).  Anything else?"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"THE NIGHT IS DARK AND FULL OF TERRORS!! 

they did that scene pretty well"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"DAMN CLIFFHANGER. 

This was the best episode of the entire series so far, hands down. "
2,4,Garden of Bones,Was the skinny guy Pyat?
2,4,Garden of Bones,Can we talk about how perfect the casting of Roose Bolton is?!
2,4,Garden of Bones,First glimpse of Roose Bolton = Unreal episode 
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I'm starting to like the actor for Stannis more and more. Stiff, bitter and without any hint of charisma whatsoever."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"My god I love Tyrion...

*That* was a threat, [see the difference](http://i.imgur.com/NWwbn.jpg)?"
2,4,Garden of Bones,I proper we rename 'Game of Thrones' to 'This Week in Joffrey Being a Right Cunt'
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Harrenhal looks amazing! And inside the walls of Qarth looks amazing too!

That healer woman that Robb speaks to is hot! She's the granddaughter of Charlie Chaplin apparently"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I really loved this episode, even though there are alot of odd things happening, and I'm not talking about the queef of death.

Opening: The Northman's Attack andAftermath - Great scenes, gave us a little insight in Rob's warfare and introduces us to Roose Bolton, lord of the Dreadfort. Little pink, that's a shame.
The pretty girl seems to be [TV Spoiler](/s ""Jeyne Westerling""). I'm not sure I like that, but we'll see what happens. 

Jeoffrey's rage - As the beating was very close to the books, in which it was even more cruel, I really liked it. Bronn, Jeoff, Tyrion, Sansa, Meryn, all characters fit. The follow-up with the whores was a bit of a stretch and very, very repulsive. It was 100% Jeoffrey, but I don't think it was necessary. The audience already hates him, and there are enough pretty teets on the screen. Now that I realize, they are the only teets that episode, right? Still, a nice part of the episode.

The Stag and the Mockingbird - This is where I got confused. What would Littlefinger do there? Maybe someone can explain it to me, but I guess he's just probing for weaknesses in the Baratheon-Tyrell alliance. Margaery was clearly wearing a vase.

New Horse, New Hope - They found Qarth, hooray! Can't remember anything about the Garden of Bones, but it sounds good.

Dead Men and Burnt Stone - Lovely shots of Harrenhal, but the Mountain looks a bit, well, underwhelming. Brienne looks bigger and burlier than him. Maisie is great, as always.

Haggle over a Codfish - Wh-, what? The scene is great, but Petyr seems so weak and fragile here. Michelle Fairley and Aiden Gillen do have the chemistry to make the scene work. Ned's bones! I was somehow hoping for a Sean Bean cameo.

Expanded prayer - Not much to say here, good acting all round and the torture was a treat.

Flaming Stags - Loved the scene. Melisandre was good, Renley was better, and Stannis is my one true king. I wonder why they didn't do it in a tent, but only really missed the peach.

The Yellow City - I liked the ""merchant"", but Xaro seemed way too nice for me. He was nice to Dany, but always exaggerated his feelings and everything. A nice introduction none the less.

Tywin to the Rescue - Great scene, Tywin is hardly even *seen* in Harrenhal in the books, so I'm interested in how this will work out.

Pious prick - Nice to see Peter Dinklage keeping up his awesome-level. Roughly straight from book to screen, so I'm not impressed, but highly satisfied.

SHADOW DEAMON BABY ABORTION TIME - Carice, Stephen and Liam work really well together and the birthing scene was just as horrifying and gruesome as I remember. That really made the episode for me.

TL;DR: Wtf Littlefinger, gg the rest."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I finally got to catch up on the last episode and now im sitting here in my room before class just mind fucked....that episode was just amazing and yet disturbing in all the right ways. Best line by far though has to be Bronn's ""There's no cure for being a cunt."" haha."
2,4,Garden of Bones,Was I the only one confused by the intro?  I thought the map usually only showed the places they were going to be in that particular episode?
2,4,Garden of Bones,"[Minor ASOS Spoiler](/b ""Holy hell the scene between Tyrion and Sansa had a hell of a lot of foreshadowing, just look at Tyrion's face when he's looking at her and talking to her...."")"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I didn't like how they changed Dany's arrival at Qarth.  I understand they need to leave out Vaes Tolorro for time reasons, but the whole scene seemed awkward, and puts Dany in Xaro's debt.  Don't like it."
2,4,Garden of Bones,Just when I thought I couldn't hate Joffrey any more....@_@
2,4,Garden of Bones,Goddamn shadow babies.
2,4,Garden of Bones,"... Holy fuck, that shadow man. "
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I love that they had Littlefinger talk to Cat about making a trade. [Minor ASoS Spoiler](/b ""It might make more sense for TV viewers next year, or in episode 10, for why Cat decides to sends Jaime off with Brienne."")"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"All I need say is that this series has taken scowling and turned it into a fine art form.  

Seriously, no one can scowl like Stannis or Tywin. "
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I am guessing Hotpie will never stare at another guard again..

2,4,Garden of Bones,"So book readers: does this mean no [ACoK Spoiler](/b ""weasel soup?"")"
2,4,Garden of Bones,I would watch an entire show just about Rob and his army.  That opening scene was perfect.  I initially thought it was going to be Arya's wolf stalking the Lannister army though. 
2,4,Garden of Bones,"It's not fair.  The books are so good that my fanboyishness cheapens me telling others just how awesome this episode is.  Best of the season, shadow baby exceeded expectations."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"What was the name that Arya said after Cersei's? [Book Spoiler](/b ""I know that the names she speaks are a hit list she keeps for people she plans to kill."") It was just hard for me to hear. Ill and pain?"
2,4,Garden of Bones,[deleted]
2,4,Garden of Bones,"What I LOVED was how subtly they showed Renly's hand shaking as he picked up the apple, showing how unsure and terrified he was. Wow, that was so great!"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"man they need to make a shirt with the quote ""the night is dark and full of terrors"""
2,4,Garden of Bones,What was the brotherhood that they kept asking about at Harrenhaal?
2,4,Garden of Bones,Instantly hating Roose Bolton and kind of suprised how happy I was seeing Tywin. 
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I thought this episode was just generally brutal... then again, I have a weak stomach for graphic torture/cruelty/humiliation. Great episode, but ...Wow."
2,4,Garden of Bones,So why is Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal?
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Watch the first 10 minutes. Wow...I'm all for the show taking liberties with new scenes, but FUCK. They pushed Joffrey into brand new levels of crazy."
2,4,Garden of Bones,My god! The black smoke from LOST!!!
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Wow, that battle scene was worse than Tyrion's in the first season."
2,4,Garden of Bones,[deleted]
2,4,Garden of Bones,Twenty minutes in and this episode is already brutal.
2,4,Garden of Bones,"he wants stannis so bad.

2,4,Garden of Bones,"Goddammit, no peach D:"
2,4,Garden of Bones,The anticipation has been building all week. I'm ready.
2,4,Garden of Bones,"They had that rat and bucket torture in 2 Fast 2 Furious, don't remember it being that graphic in the book."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Alright I'm relieved the scene between Renly and Stannis was handled well.  Probably the best scene of the episode.  I was worried for a little while because that line he would say in the trailers ""no one wants you for their king"" didn't seem like him.

Also Stannis and Melisandre are growing on me."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Sounds like the shadow baby accomplished what it was meant to, in that everyone's going 'WTF Mel'. Can't wait to watch the episode!"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Thoughts while watching

While reading, I never really hated Joffrey that much because I felt that although he's a prick, he was born into privilege, and is a mostly product of his parents. I could barely watch his scene with the two prostitutes, and it really made me hate his character for the first time. Very well done.

That first shot of Harrenhall was better than anything I had imagined in the books. I imagined it big, but it looks bigger than any structure I could imagine being in that world. And I love how Arya immediately knows what dead people smell like. It's indicative of her growth from a protected little ""lady"" to what she has become while on the road. I loved Hot Pie pissing himself. ""Is there gold in the village?""

I really hope that the show stays faithful to the book and Danyerys [ACOK](/b ""adopts the traditional Qartheen women's fashion by keeping one breast exposed"")

Petyr is such a snake. And Melisandre's birth scene was excellent. "
2,4,Garden of Bones,"The impact one episode of GoT, and that episode not being a season finale, has on the audience never cease to impress me. This show is made out of gold my friends."
2,4,Garden of Bones,Kind of bothered me that Stannis didn't have a crown in his meeting with Renly. Seems to me that if you are trying to put your claim over another Kings then you would make sure to look as kingly as he does. Politics is all appearance after all.
2,4,Garden of Bones,"[ACoK Spoiler](/b ""Are they just going to skip Cortnay Penrose's death? I thought the shadow birth was described when Davos takes Melisendre to kill Penrose, not Renly."")"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Arya is Tywin's cup-girl? Oh, bittersweet irony."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Danys smoking hot, especially when shes feisty. 
Tywins a BAWS. His scene was great. Showed how smart and collected he is. Definitely one of the most capable characters in the show, but I wonder if he knows Arya's true identity. It would seem to me that he must have seen her before.  "
2,4,Garden of Bones,"So yeah, thanks Melisandre, I think I'm [tokophobic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokophobia) now. &#3232;\_&#3232;"
2,4,Garden of Bones,what happened to the old mountain?
2,4,Garden of Bones,"WHAT IN THE FUCK

NO REALLY

WHAT IN THE FUCK"
2,4,Garden of Bones,Tywin looking at one big piece of the puzzle right there. If he only knew what he held. 
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I haven't read the books, but isn't the whole Renly being gay thing not openly talked about in them? Everyone seems to know.."
2,4,Garden of Bones,I noticed Dontos Hollard in the throne room. He was in a weird costume.
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Thoughts, despite the fact that I'm quite drunk, and I doubt many people will read this. I really don't like the direction they're pushing Joffrey in, it's good that a lot of people dislike him, but he really should not be evil (I understand, perhaps he was trying to send a point to tryion, but viewer-wise I don't think that was effective). The entire point of the show is there is now black and white. ehhhhhhhhhhh.  
On a good note, I do hope the producers play with our perception of Tywin. There is a lot to like, and a lot to dislike about him, it will be interesting to see what happens."
2,4,Garden of Bones,I forget if it was like this in the book but only 12 of the 13 of Qarth greeted the Mother of Dragons outside of the city gates. I counted combining a couple screens.
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Those two guards really suck at interrogations. Not only do they use torture to gain information, they still kill the guy IN FRONT OF THE OTHER PRISONERS."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I'm kinda disappointed we didn't get a reaction shot of Hot Pie when Arya is revealed as a girl. That was one of my favourite minor character bits in the book, and it would have been amazing to watch, if only for a couple seconds. I get that Hot Pie isn't really that important, but he's a good foil for Arya/Gendry.

Still, all around great episode. I'm feeling that old hate for Joff resurfacing, Tyrion is being properly cunning (I was a little worried about the handling of the king's landing politics after the first few episodes this season), nice to see that Quarth depicted as a more tasteful version of what I imagined, the CG on the shadow creature was top-notch, and I'm super excited for [Next Episode](/s ""the non readers' cries of anguish when Renley is murdered in his tent before fighting a single battle."")"

2,4,Garden of Bones,"With the intro/recap, I was reminded of how much went on in the last ep. I mean, I watched it all, but seeing them do nearly 2 mins worth of all the arcs that they covered, wow. And seeing everything that happened today. WOW. The plot moves fast, and I'm glad they're able to handle so many simultaneous scenes at once."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Hmm. Did they change the order of events from the books? I'm midway through the 2nd one, and I'm already a good ways past the part where [Book Spoiler](/b ""Renley is killed by the shadow""), but I don't remember reading about the shadow baby scene. Did I skip it by accident?"
2,4,Garden of Bones,This was the best episode of the entire show so far. Every sequence was fantastic. Really made up for the somewhat lackluster first three episodes.
2,4,Garden of Bones,WTF was Melisandre eating? What were the time differences between each episode? OR was this her magic at work? 
2,4,Garden of Bones,so erm what was that shadow guy at the end?

2,4,Garden of Bones,"Anyone else a little weirded out by the promo for next week featuring [TV Spoiler](/s ""Jaqen telling Arya she owes the RED god three lives"")?"
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Did anybody else care that Davos used a row boat to smuggle Melisandre to shore. I mean you don't need super smuggling skills to navigate with a rowboat, it should of had a sail on it... Man I can't give this show a break :D"
2,4,Garden of Bones,Why am I hating Little Finger more than I did when I read the books? I absolutely loath him now. It will be interesting though to see how it blends into the future.
2,4,Garden of Bones,What did I just witness... 
2,4,Garden of Bones,Do we meet Great Belwas in this episode? I can't keep track compared to the books...
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Holy hell, I've never seen that rat torture thing before."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"After reading the comments I think everyone, including people who have read the books, had a very 'WTF!?!' reaction to the end of the episode. 

I was honestly unsure whether they would do the scene as they were being pretty light on the magic and monsters in the first series."
2,4,Garden of Bones,"Did they swap around Roose Bolton & Tywins' roles? I thought Arya was cup bearer to Roose? Did I forget something?

Agree with everyone about the new mountain. He sucks. What the fuck were they thinking?

Its not like its hard for casual fans to figure out but I think they should have made it clear the shadow figure was Stannis' silhouette. "
2,4,Garden of Bones,"To all of you who have read the books. DAE feel as if the show is a little bit rushed, or is it just me? Don't get me wrong, the show is fucking perfect, and I pray to the old gods that every episode will leak before their original airing time. "
2,4,Garden of Bones,"I appreciated the clear explanation as to why all of Davos' fingers had been shortened by a knuckle.  I always thought when I was reading that was one of my favorite things about Davos, how he was always stressing about Stannis' plans and grabbing for his bag of fingertips around his neck."

2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"Roy Dotrice hamming it up as Wisdom Hallyne was epic. I had the stupidest grin on my face the entire time. Tyrion needs to go back to have random, doddering conversations with him every episode just for shits and giggles. 

Uncle Tywin -which is what I'll call him from now on- is taking a shine to Arya, which show an interesting side to his character we didn't get to see. They have great chemistry (in an acting sense) on screen.

I don't particularly mind ""de-gaying"" Xaro for the show, the character is a bit of a bad cliche in the books and this version is quite intruiging. I would seriously consider marrying him. 

I'm going to have nightmares about Pyat Pree for a long time, aren't I?

2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Hodor!
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,My favorite characters so far have been Renly and Theon... what is worng with me.

2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"No Damphair, OK, fine, whatever, but I DEMAND Cleftjaw!!
"
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,No love for the Stannis - Onion Knight scene?  It wasn't hugely significant comparatively but it was my favorite and gave me goosebumps.
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"Off the top of my head... wow. Acting. This was one of the best acted episodes in the series. Everyone just knocked it out of the park. Especially Arya. That was just amazing. I *think* I approve of the changes they did to her storyline. [Book Spoiler](/b ""She still *wasted* her name, but she was still responsible for the death of the Tickler. Even if it wasn't quite as visceral."") And her interaction with Tywin was just fucking brilliant. Best. Poker face. Ever. And Jaquen Hagar couldn't be better. 

The scene with Brienne and Catelyn after they've fled just sent chills down my spine. Christie (sp?) is just nailing Brienne's combo of heartbreak, naivete/honor and earnest desire to be, well, a knight. [AFFC-ADWD Spoiler](/b ""And knowing what happens with her and Lady Stoneheart was just twisting the knife in my guts that whole scene."")

Dany is moving the story right along. And Tyrion/Bronn -- yay, wildfire!  It was also fun to see Tyrion pushing Lancel around and getting a glimpse of the unrest in the city.

Bran was awesome. Bronn was awesome. Iceland is awesome, Jon is pretty, Sam is funny and Dolorous Edd is Azor Ahai. Fucking Theon. Fucking Theon! And last/first but not least, the shadow assassin in action was impressive.

Also, adorable baby CGI dragons!   "
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"only just now realized why Loras volunteered to [Book Spoiler](/b ""storm Dragonstone for Cersei"")... my, am I slow witted."

2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Xaro's vault... do not remember any mention of a vault in the books.

That actor must have a line in his contract that says:

iii.  Actor will deliver best line in any episode he appears in.

Everything he said this episode was a Crowning Line of Awesome."
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"I have one question (that I confirmed on re-watching last night):

**WHERE IS NED?!**

Baelish brings what's left of Ned to Catrelyn at Renly's camp... but when Cat and Brienne hit rocks after ""Smokey"" kills Renly, all you see is the two women, with two horses, and no box o' Ned."
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"My Game of Thrones weekly addiction: Watch the episode.  Immediately after it's done, download it and watch it again for missed parts. Watch it a third time the next day, and possibly a fourth time before bed the next day. There's so much going on that I have to watch each episode at least 3 times to soak everything in.

Also Ed was hilarious.

"
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"Not looking at comments, just a little ways into the episode. But when Aria says ""Anyone can be killed"". And just stares the old guy lannister down, THAT WAS THE BEST FUCKING SCENE EVER. HOLY SHIT. THIS ACTRESS. THIS SHOW. THIS NETWORK. JUST YES."

Is that correct.. "
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"My favorite part: Random rat squeeing and running past in the background, when Tyrion was looking at the jars of wildfire. "
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"Do you know the one thing that niggles me about the fact that Arya is Tywin's cup bearer? It's not a 'That's not how it happened!' thing; seeing as it's a very clever way to transition through events while saving time and complication...

It's the fact that Tywin is so competent; and I mean they've established him that way - He knows Arya is a female on sight. He knows the advantages to not killing prisoners. He knows Arya is from the North. So damn competent. But he's having extended discussions with his daughter's missing hostage. Damn, Tywin; you should know better.

... But really it's just a niggly complaint. Their conversation was pretty sweet to watch."

2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Pyromancers look like Tim the sorcerer from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"Not a major deal, but for some reason, JH's use of ""I"" bugs me more than ""Arya's choices"" or ""No nudity in this episode."" For the one: I think Arya sensed JH was dangerous, but not **how dangerous** (or capable), until she made her first choice. For the other: I'll be the first to admit my memory is shite, but I don't remember one shot of nudity that couldn't somehow be excused as highlighting something about a character. Apparently, it wasn't needed this ep. Plus I think, figuratively, Lancel counts as a boob. Which reminds me - I think this one had some of Tyrion's best lines yet. ""Demon Monkey?!?"""

2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"Oh man. They were just teasing us with that Renly scene.

*Dramatic camera angle that focuses an odd distance between the two characters, rather than leaving the space between them small.  Renly's well defined shadow cast perfectly on the wall, directly at the centre of the camera view.*

One of the greatest changes from book series to TV was writing Bronn more into the fold.  Jerome Flynn plays him perfectly.  Tyrion's character/dialogue benefits so much from the presence of Bronn...can't express how wonderfully they play off each other.

2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"I can't shake the feeling that we're being rushed around between 5 different shows. This style is great for books, but for an hour a week on tv I feel the stories aren't getting their due. Does anybody else feel this way?"
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,I don't think the Frog Eaters will be making the surprise reveal that I was hoping for.
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"The episode seemed really flamboyant compared to the other episodes.  Dany's scenes had lots of colors, and it looked like the characters themselves were more... *colorful*.  As in, their clothes and armor were brighter compared to how dark and grim the last episode was.  Not saying that the flamboyancy is bad, it just contrasts to the broody feeling of the other episodes.  Anyhow, I loved it.  Everything about the episode.  Just perfect."
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Valar Morghulus...loving Jaquen so much!
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,Where are Jojen and Meera Reed???
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"You know what I just noticed was missing... No one asked where Ser Barristan was. [ACOK](/b ""I like the fact that Renly asks both Catelyn and Robb if Ser Barristan was with their forces, and the line about him swearing to join up with the true king."")"
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"Come on, Jorah! Take that dragon-mother into your strong, rugged arms and just hold her tight."
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"GAAAH RENLY. I thought he deserved a better death. I had so many dreams of him and Robb storming King's Landing... /sobs
And Stannis, making me like him less and less. He was definitely the Baratheon brother I was hoping would lose.

LOVING Arya's storyline with Gendry (stacked much?) and her lines with Tywin. Love her more and more every episode.

No Joffrey or Sansa in this episode, though honestly I don't think I want to see Joffrey in another episode unless he's getting his head cut off.

Love the Tyrion + Bronn duo. They go great together."
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,I know I'm late to the party but what the fuck is up with that warlock dude? Looks like he stepped right out of Innsmouth.
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"Was anyone else kind of let down by scene with Dagmer and Theon? Not only did the actor look nothing like the four-lipped, scar-faced, master-at-arms I was waiting for, but they had Dagmer [TV Spoiler](/s ""plant the idea in Theon's head about attacking Torrhen's Square,"") which to me was a step backward in Theon's character progression toward becoming a born-again Ironman.

PS: And yes, I know, maybe face prosthetics would have been too expensive for a minor character, but the dude didn't even look tough enough--nor psychotically-happy enough--to fill the role."
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,No Ros!
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,I was really looking forward to seeing Meera Reed and her spear. Guess not :(
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"Although I could watch the new episodes live on Sky Player on my computer upstairs, as my internet connection is unreliable and we have a huge HD TV downstairs I live with the painful awkwardness of watching the sex scenes in the same room as my parents...so why on the first occasion my parents aren't around is there no even the slightest hint of a sideboob?!"
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"Arya was pronouncing it wrong! It should be ""m'lord,"" not ""my lord."" That's a tip off to Tywin that he's been talking to a highborn lady of the North."
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,wait a minute...did we see ZERO boobs in this episode?!!! 
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,The King is taking point on the fortifications of the city... Well that will work out well
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"[Book Spoiler](/b ""does this mean they are eliminating the many faced god from the show??"")"
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"A couple of thoughts on tonight's episode:

-- I loved that the opening scene was Renly's death. [CoK Spoiler](/b ""Small detail that I wish they had kept in - the blade is supposed to go through the throat not the chest"")

-- Jaqen and the wishes, at last! However, and I know book readers are going to be really upset about this...as I am [SoS Spoiler](/b ""I can't believe the Tickler ended up being chosen. One of Arya's finest scenes is in that tavern when she's stabbing him and yelling 'Is there gold in the village? Silver?' I wonder how they will handle that eventually? A serious shame if they cut the scene. I suppose they can always put Polliver in there."")

-- Dagmer Cleftjaw and Quorin Halfhand both looked AWESOME. Asha/Yara still pisses me off, she really hasn't grown on me at all yet. 

-- Maybe my favorite scene in the episode was between Tywin and Arya when he discussed her origin and Robb. Was that originally a conversation between Roose and Arya? And was ""Any man can die"" from the books? Been awhile since I read CoK

-- More Roose Bolton next week, hell yes! Did anybody notice in the trailer he looks a little more haggard, a little more pale? Not sure if it was the lighting but he's definitely looked different. I hope they'll factor in the [CoK Spoiler](/b ""Leech Lord side to him."")

-- The news from Winterfell [CoK Spoiler](/b ""Presumably will be Torrhen Square being attacked? Exactly how far in Theon's story are we going to go this season? Still mad they won't have Reek. I really hope they don't make Roose commit Reek's actions."")

2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"I know this is asking a lot... but could someone post a still frame of the scene with qorin/mormont/jon looking at the wildling camp across the mountains, with the wildling fire highlighted? I am colorblind and I couldn't pick it out when I was watching the episode. I really want to see where the camp was among that beautiful mountain pass. "
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"So......I just spent all of yesterday watching season 1 and all of today catching up with season 2. I'm pretty damn upset I have to wait a week to see the next episode now. Also, I wish the whole show was about Arya. But then again, I love Daeneyrs and the dragons and...I think I have a crush on both her handmaidens or whatever they are..."
2,5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,"I love that we are starting to refer to Xaro as 'Ducksauce'. He turned out much less slimy than when I read about him in the book. Or, at least, the actor playing him makes him come across as less slimy."

loved seeing Ghost though, and that wildfire looks awesome."

Some absolutely brutal scenes with Theon/Rodrik and Sansa/Sandor.  But not just brutality for brutality's sake.  Those things take an emotional toll.

2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Interesting how Daenerys has, like, almost none of her original people left at this point. A couple of warriors and Jorah Mormont, maybe?

2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"I like Ygritte's casting, they've really done a great job finding actors and actresses to fit the characters."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"* fuck you theon. 
* go robb's advisor's bastard son. 
* jon is a pussy. 
* ghost is keeping it real #damnitfeelsgoodtobenorthofthewall.

* Hodor, keep on Hodoring. 

Just my 2 cents :)

*EDIT: Names"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Well, they're changing how Jon, Ygritte and Qhorin play out beyond the wall."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,This was the most unbelievable episode yet. Why would a wildling have a shaved pussy?
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Rodrik NOOOOOOOOOO!
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Well, there goes Dany's leverage."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Jaqen's few seconds on screen were once again one of my favorite moments in the episode. This actor is doing an amazing job bringing the character to life.  

His faces in response to Arya's demands were hilarious"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,The pacing of this episode was perfect.  I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,All you peopled that liked Dany's servant. That was your fault.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Lollys, anyone?"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Failing to cleanly execute someone is always such a brutal depiction of weakness. Bravo. That scene was incredible. It actually made me feel worse for Theon than anyone else, which I think is what it should do (poor boy is trapped in an impossible ethical situation and more literally). "
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,[deleted]
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"I usually write full thoughts for an episode, but this is all I need to put here because I literally exclaimed ""YES!"" and pumped my fist in the air when I heard it:

""Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and take Winterfell before the new moon.""

Theon's storyline was moved WAY UP, but I am so glad that [CoK](/b ""Ramsay Bolton will be in the storyline at some point"")
"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"What the hell happened to the host Ser Rodrik was leading? As far as I remember [ACoK/SOS?](/b ""they were betrayed and killed by Ramsay's men as they get to Winterfell"") but it didn't happen like that in the episode. Did Rodrik just decide he didn't need his hundreds(?) of men and he'd just march in there alone? Or were they killed by the handful of iron men who came from the sea bitch?"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Xaro Xaron Ducksauce?
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"dafuq
"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"did that last scene happen in the book.  its been a while since i read acok, so idr."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"When Cat comes back to camp and meets with Robb. [Book Spoiler](/b ""I got chills when she says he has to stay true to his promise to Lord Frey, just as Roose comes walking up..."")"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,That scene was fucking brutal.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,">Welcome to Whose Throne is it Anyways, where everything is made up and the books don't matter!

That about summed up this episode for me. Yet, I loved it all the same."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,I want two very special ladies to appear tonight.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Man, what a great episode. We actually got to see everyone."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Even while reading the books I couldn't figure this out: Why is Osha loyal to the Starks? 
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,The opening scene was perfect. They did a great job capturing the taking of Winterfell.  One of the best scenes in the show so far. 
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Watching too many Discovery channel survival shows had me yelling at the screen during the Jon & Ygritte scene, get off the ground, find shelter, PUT A HAT ON!
"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"I really wanted Sansa to say ""yes"" when Joffrey asked her if her brother was a prince :\"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Add one more for the Joffrey slap reel
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Wildings are hot... what? who said that?
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Everytime I watch this show I flap my hands, close my eyes, squawk, hold my breath, skitter about, clutch my chest-

all this for a show. 
 


Some fucking tv show. "
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"A whole lot of amazing parallels this episode.

Both Tywin and Robb called out Arya and Talisa/Jeyne with their ability to read, alluding to the fact that the girls are definitely hiding who they are/where theyre from.

Both Bran and Robb just wanted to ask Theon ""Why?""

The Qartheen began his scene with Dany about his bad dreams keeping him up, and then Dany finished by saying her dreams come true. "
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Every time Tyrion hits Joffrey, I get conflicted feelings. On one hand, he's hitting Joffrey. That's pretty neat. On the other, I feel with each slap he's approaching the limit of Joffrey's cowardice and getting closer to his cruelty. This worries me, from what I hear these books are not kind to you if you love a character. "
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"I don't know if this was mentioned, but Jaime is dyslexic? "
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,fucking. FUCKING THEON MOTHERFUCKING GREYJOY.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Littlefinger had to have saw Arya and is keeping it to himself.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,I have a tv-theory: the only reason the the Halfhand and his new companions have survived this long is because they wear hats. Yeeah.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Best episode of the season so far.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"It was hilarious for me because my mom and I text during the show since I am away at college right now and she texted me before the show began ""I wonder when Winterfell is going to be taken over?"". I, of course, received the text right when Maester Luwin is rushing to send out the raven and thought to myself, well I guess now is a good time is any for this major plot point. Haha, HBO really started this episode off with a punch. "
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"I have a question, and I don't want it answered if it involves any spoilers of course. 
In the scene where Jon Snow is about to cut of Ygrittes' head she say something alone the lines of: ""Do it, Bastard"".
Does she say that just cause it's considered a mean thing to say, or does she really know that he is a Ned Starks Bastard child?
Just something I were thinking about. :)"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"From last weeks discussion:
YES they got rid of the Arya-Tickler scene and YES I was wondering how they were going to use the second kill and how they would justify Arya not just using it to kill Tywin. But well, they did all of it. No complaints whatsoever. That's why I love this show."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Oh man I just cracked up during the riot scene when some random guy hits Sandor in the chest with a rock! WTF was he thinking? I also found it strange how Sandor only killed 3 of the potential rapists. The bald dude holding Sansa's right leg is left unharmed...
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"I don't understand why Osha didn't just kill Theon. Retaking Winterfell doesn't seem all that more risky than trying to escape it with Bran and Rickon, but killing Theon is an overall plus in either case. This is not how it went down in the books, which I'm generally okay with, but this doesn't really make sense to me."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,was i the only one mesmerized by the scenery north of the wall?
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"[Book Spoiler] (/b ""Why the fuck are Jojen and Meera Reed not in the series? They skipped them, and they are very important characters in the whole Bran side of the story. I don't even know if this is a spoiler if they won't introduce them at all."")"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Rob has good taste now that she has cleaned up... ME GUSTA
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,[deleted]
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED.

Dany's dragons stolen? um....

side notes: Sandor and Sansa made me cry; Jaqen is a bamf; goddamn [book spoiler](/b ""Jeyne"") just tell him who you are."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"With the ending dany scene my non-reader friends look to me ""OMG! Who stole the dragons!?"" me, being completely thrown ""I DONT KNOW, THIS DOESNT HAPPEN IN THE BOOKS!"" ...they don't beleive me but, I feel pleasantly suprised that I have no idea whats going on. "
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"[Book Spoiler](/b ""Man, Theon is a dick and all, but he didn't kill Rodrik Cassel."")"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Ygritte should have stayed at Downton.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Remember Tonks from the Harry Potter movies? We just got to see her tits
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,YOU KNOW NOTHING JON SNOW!
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Looks like we'll also find out [acok Spoiler](/b ""Jeyne Westerling really is tonight."")"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,What's with the dude with the creepy voice?
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"So... stolen dragons, eh guys?"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"I don't get why Joffery was so pissed about having shit thrown at him. It was a bit of an improvement on his face.

I really like that this show can actually surprise me still despite having read the books, as long as the pull off the dragon kidnapping (dragonnaping?) well this should be interesting. "
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Am I the only one wondering where the hell Jorah went? 
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"[Book Spoiler](/b ""Blergh. I hate the humanization of Shae too"")"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"fuck Theon, what a piece of scum!
"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,I was on the edge of my seat the whole episode. It was fantastic!
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Yet another great Tywin-Arya scene.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"I loved Tywin discussing how he spent 4 hours a day teaching Jaime to read. Shows how devoted and mixed this guy is, and brings more depth to the theme of family that this show is really starting to focus on.

Also reminds me of my own dad always working with me to make sure I excelled in school. Like Jaime, I hated it, but I can appreciate that now."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"So...uhm...where the fuck was Jorah during that whole slaughter at Dany's residence?  If he wasn't with Dany in person, where else would he be?"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Hey its Rickon!
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Dany teaches negotiating 101! It wasn't very effective
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"at some point in the riot scene, a random tit just pops out."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"[TV Spoiler](/s ""i thought marrying off the daughter was just a ploy to find the traitor?"") "
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"If Irri actually died, this show is pulling a GRRM, and it wasn't even in the books! I thought the books were enough, but my god if they kill off people that don't die in the books... Not my Amrita Acharia, no, it can't be. This is  Ned all over again, only 10 years later. My god............. No........"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"**slash** fuck **hack** jesus christ man, so sorry **cleave** holy fucking shit just die already **kicks head**"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,No Bronn tonight  :(
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,[removed]
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,This will be all Harry Potter fans favourite episodes..... Tonks
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Do the dragons get stolen in the book? I can't remember that ever happening :/
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,How did Greyjoy take Winterfell with only 30 men? I know that most of the men aren't at Winterfell but they should have left at least 100 of them to work the castle. 
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Question. Where were Bronn when shit hit the fan in Kings Landning? Isn't he Tyrions body guard and supposed to be at his side at all time?   
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Damn, Sandor! Took your sweet time showing up!"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Well, another episode ends with me screaming at the screen.  Not the dragons!!!

Also, Arya's starting to get sloppy, she's got to tighten up!  That's at least twice this episode she's nearly been found out by Tywin.  Why wouldn't she have tucked that note into her shirt or something?  She's way smarter than that!"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"This comment is about my disappointment about the absence of some characters, so I've just put the whole thing in spoiler brackets...
[ACOK](/b ""I'm really very disappointed that it seems the Reeds won't be making it into the series... or at least into this season. They were some of my favourites from the books and I thought they really provided a good guidance for Bran. I'm not sure how they're going to properly give him a good standing on the journey. I was keen to see how they'd be depicted, but now it seems that won't happen :-("")"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,What did the note Arya took say? Are we supposed to know?
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,I want to know what happened to Beric Dondarrion and Barristan Selmy!
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"[Book Spoiler](/b ""I can't remember and don't think she has but....Has Tysha been mentioned in the TV series yet (Tyrions wife)?"")"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,I'd actually like the story in the series to be different from the books to a certain extent. It adds the drama of not knowing who is going to die all over again.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"So, my buddy and I are royally confused. Theon and his ""skeleton crew"" on the sea bitch somehow have enough men to deal with Sir Roderick's ""few hundred"" men at torrhen's square while simultaneously taking winterfell?

The only thing we could come up with is that the skeleton crew was just the crew, and maybe plenty of troops were already on board?

Amazing episode. I get so damn mad when they end."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"My god, I was hoping the riot in King's Landing would be good, but this was fucking *intense.*"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"[acok Spoiler](/b ""Can't wait for the Riot in King's Landing!"")"
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,Whether it is the book or the show... Arya is still and always will be a BAWSE

2,6,The Old Gods and the New,[removed]
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"this scene is making me so happy right now, fuck Joffrey. Watch out Tyrion."
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,So happy they mentioned the Bastard of Bolton.
2,6,The Old Gods and the New,"Help me out here. I can understand plot changes to condense long sections (that said, still disappointed by a lot of them) BUT... WHY? WHY did they have to make Myrcella cry?

[Book Spoiler - some from Feast for Crows](/b ""It's a key point in the books that she is strong and actually pretty happy about leaving, and this is part of the key to why it's believed that she would make a better/stronger/smarter leader than Tommen once Joffrey's out of the way and once she's in a region where the elder sister can inherit."")"

2,7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin and Arya make an amazing combination
2,7,A Man Without Honor,God Damn it Theon... My hatred for you is only rivaled by my hatred for Jeoffrey 
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte's doing a good job getting inside Jon's head. It's a mixture of cute and intimidating 
2,7,A Man Without Honor,THANK YOU DANY. If I had to listen to him talk about how he came from nothing one more time I was going to shit all over my television.

Jaime's Brienne interactions were awesome.

Alfie Allen is the shit.

Seems like a glaring omission considering all the attention it gets in the book."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Man, I keep thinking every episode is the best, and that it can't be beat. Then the next one comes out. So much awesome in this one.

Ygritte removed all doubts about how good the actress would be. Dat wildling swag.

Qaithe, Jorah, Pyat Pree and Daxos (although it was changed from the books) were awesome.

The scene with Cersei... man, after all that she's done, they managed to humanize her.

The scene with Shae threatening that woman.

The scenes with Arya and Tywin...

Jaime's escape and confrontation with Catelyn were awesome.

And all the scenes with Theon. Man, the music that played at the end of this episode... chilling."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"At first I read it on the TV guide as ""A man without hodor"". I like it more like that."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Despite the Tywin - Arya relationship being totally against canon, I'm freaking loving it. "
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"RICKON AND BRAN!?!?!?!

One part of me just believes Theon used fake bodies or something but the other part of me knows i'm watching game of thrones and they give not a single fuck about who they kill..."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Wow those were some crispy kids
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"I was convinced that Theon was about to behead the Maester. I sat bolt upright and screamed ""NO!!"" like I did at the beginning of Ghost of Harrenhal. 

It was much worse than I was expecting. "
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Needed more Arya.  Also, those warlocks are scary as fuck."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Wow, they nailed the ending. Exactly how I felt in the book when that scene happened"

2,7,A Man Without Honor,I can't believe Jaime insulted Catelyn like that on Mother's Day
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Thoughts on tonight's episode

- Jaime Lannister truly was the star of it. I understand why the actor said this was his favorite scene, and I think he was referring to the one with cousin Lannister

- Roose Bolton had one line, but that look at Robb when he invited Talisa into the tent and dismissed him...chills.

- THEON!!! Fucking scumbag

- We finally got the line from Ygritte. And she seems to get more and more attractive, doesn't she?

- Arya and Tywin, once again, steal the show. Though Jaime's scene was the best, Arya and Tywin continue to provide the most entertaining scenes in the show. If at least one of them isn't nominated for an Emmy, it will be a tragedy

- Previews for next week said only 2 episodes left, there will be 3.

- And Finally - RATTLECAGE!!!"
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Still would have preferred the image of Sansa trying to stuff her mattress into the fireplace. The idea of the Hound seeing her bed though, creeped me out."

2,7,A Man Without Honor,I bet Arya will do something awesome today :)

2,7,A Man Without Honor,"hopefully things change. But...am I the only one that is a little pissed that the wildlings already caught Jon?! I was waiting for [CoK] (/b ""the Halfhand orders and death all season and now they are changing that all up!!"")"
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin's conversations with Ayra are like; 'I sure like you better than everyone in my family.'
2,7,A Man Without Honor,aw that's cute. i never noticed they had a little house sigil pop up next to each actor's name in the title credits. and they have swords and shit next to the production crew.
2,7,A Man Without Honor,If Tywin were king I think he'd make Arya his hand ... or his closest advisor.
2,7,A Man Without Honor,holy slit throats batman
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"What's up with Jaime admitting to the incest? Same in the scene between Tyrion and Cersei, does he actually acknowledge it too? I'm slightly lost.
Finally, the ending of today's episode turned my stomach. And I don't mind looking at gore. But this... fuck Theon."

[SoS Spoiler](/b ""Goddamn foreshadowing!"")"
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Oh shit, they actually showed fucking bodies.

I was just thinking it was gonna be heads."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,They seem to be making Cersei a much more sympathetic character in the show than she was in the books. I feel a little bad for her..
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"I may not like Shae's character change, but that was pretty damn cool."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Anyone else incredibly excited to see who they cast as the Bastard of Dreadfort? He's going to be incredibly important for the next season or so and hopefully they continue their excellent casting!
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Tywin onto Arya? I like this development.
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Fucking Theon reminds me of an anxious caged dog.
2,7,A Man Without Honor,The Hound certaintly brings the blood. In more ways than one
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Wait? Only two episodes left? But tonight was the seventh...
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Question regarding the book, because I've just started re-reading but somebody please refresh me on this point. Has to do with the 13 in Qarth and what happened tonight:

[CoK Spoiler](/b ""I know the 13 are not killed in Qarth in that manner, betrayed by Pyat Pree and Xaro. What actually happens to them? And where the hell do you guys see this going, Xaro claiming himself the king of Qarth? What the fuck?"")

2,7,A Man Without Honor,Yes the deaths at the end were shocking but how is no one mentioning the necromancer/warlock? That blew my mind
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Is it bad that I'm starting to actually like the Lannisters? (except Joffrey of course)
2,7,A Man Without Honor,R.I.P. Bran and Rickon :(
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"OH MY GOD... [Book Spoiler](/b ""what on earth is going on in Qarth. Maybe I missed a couple chapters in the book, but this isn't remotely close to what happened (as i recall it)."")"

2,7,A Man Without Honor,"[Speculation] (/g ""I literally just read the bit about Bran and Rickon being killed at the mill and their heads being tarred and spiked on the wall before I watched this episode, and after seeing the tarred bodies hoisted up at the end of the episode, I feel like Theon killed two other boys and tarred them beyond recognition to avoid being shamed by letting them escape. Gods be good I hope that's the case. When I read that they were murdered in the book my heart sank so low."")

While on the case of Bran, I'm so disappointed that the didn't include the two Reeds in the show. I really like Jojen in the books. He adds a lot to the mythos of Westoros with his green dreams and trying to help Bran understand himself. "
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"You know what, that takes the cake for best episode so far for me."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Where the hell is Hot Pie and Gendry?
2,7,A Man Without Honor,A man without Hodor.
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Are y'all loving Ygritte as much as I am? Rose Leslie is doing a fantastic job.
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Who is the man without honor? Jamie? Jon?
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Oh, how I love Ygritte!"
2,7,A Man Without Honor,I'm probably going to start reading the series soon and I was wondering how far along the show is into the books? Is it still on the first one or has it moved onto the second or what?
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"It's like they're having a contest as to who is the most hated character... Joffrey was possibly in the lead after last week, and then Theon just blew him out of the water."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"The first Hodor was not from who I expected. Theon, just stealing from everyone now."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Some of these off canon scenes are amazing. They really keep me on my toes. 
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Still disappointed with the new Mountain. I fear for [ASoS](/b ""his duel with Martell."")"
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Am I insane in thinking that the crazy coup didn't happen in the books? At all? 

My sister (non-book reader) and I both had the same reaction: ""King what? Who?"""
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"""it's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on his head.”_ So true Tyrion, so true. "
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Love how Jaime is so proud of only fucking Cersei when she is sleeping with their cousin! 
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"THe leaders of Qarth didn't die in the books correct?  I haven't read CoK recently, and can't quite remember."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,THAT ENDING!! WAS IT REALLY THEM???
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"There it is, Ygritte!"
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Aww, nice little brother and sister moment."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,I'm not sure where this whole Tywin/Arya thing is going.

2,7,A Man Without Honor,"You're off the hook for this week, Greg Spence."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"My like for Jaime Lannister's actor/personality is not in line with my dislike for his actions. If he keeps talking as much as he has been, I'll probably just give him an ""oh, you!"" face every time he does something terrible.

Then again, that sword in Catelyn's hand seems to pose a threat to that last bit about talking more."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"I don't think those bodies are that of Bran and Rickon. Simply because if it was them, Theon would have showed the bodies of Hodor and Osha. Especially Osha, because she fucked him over, big time. 

Also, the Hodor giggle followed by ""Hodor"" was super fucking cute. 

Arya and Tywin, definitely an amazing combo. Too bad they're on the opposite sides of the war. 

Maester Luwin's cry at the end was heartbreaking. It showed he truly cared about the boys. 

I'm a little upset that Jaqen wasn't showed at all. But oh well. 

I don't know about others, but I thought Gregor Clegane actually felt scary today. His voice isn't sharp as that of the previous actor, but it's chilly and makes you want to sit in a corner and cry. "
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Can't lie...Ygritte was turning me on...
2,7,A Man Without Honor,God help me I liked Cersei and Tywin in this episode. I ain't even mad
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"All in all a great mother's day episode on Game of Thrones; kidnapped and murdered children! EDIT: Oh, and the son that makes his mother cry because he's soo uncontrollably cruel. And if you made Cersei cry, that's saying something."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Sad the bondage scenes with Ygritte had to end.
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Ytrig says "" I didnt want to want it,Ohhhh but I did""                                            
And I swear my sword was hard as Valerian steel"
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Yeahhh I can't wait for [Book Spoiler](/b ""Daenerys to crush the House of the Undying!""). I seriously hope that's in this next episode, but I'd probably still be happy if they stretched it between multiple episodes in order to do it justice :D

2,7,A Man Without Honor,Why is this post up so early?
2,7,A Man Without Honor,Ygritte is almost too sexy
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"There is no character, televised or written, that makes me as mad as Theon Greyjoy does. I literally hate everything about him, from his brain dead statements to his purely evil actions. He turned on the one house that treated him like family. Robb called Theon a brother, and all the Starks loved him. Now that he killed those kids, I hope he suffers the most painful death of anyone in the series.

2,7,A Man Without Honor,How many episodes are in season 2??!
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"That singular blood rider standing back behind Dany cracked me up, he looked so very confused."
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"This was definitely my favorite episode yet. Ygritte giving Jon shit, Jaime giving Brienne shit, Sansa and the Hound interacting, Cersei's scene with Tyrion. God. All so great. The Winterfell part was really well done too.

Alton, I'm sorry, bud. You had to die. People kept confusing you with Gendry.

Even though that bit wasn't in the book, I think their handling Dany's part really well.

I was really wondering how they'd do the end of the episode, as well, and I got to say, that was some gruesome shit.
[ACOK](/b ""My dad turned to me afterwards though, and demanded to know who the two bodies were supposed to be, because he knew it couldn't be Bran and Rickon. For once, my dad was spot on. I'm so proud."")"
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"What was Jaime's line to his cousin in the cage:

I was thinking maybe HBO didn't really do a great job convincing the audience, but then I just realized that it's sooo much easier to trick readers than viewers when it comes to that."")"
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"The Tywin/Arya dialogue: Tywin offering Arya a good meal.  The stories of the Dragons attacking from the air and Arya being a ""Student of History"" with attention to the female heroines. Charles Dance has my undivided attention. 

Also Egrit's puckish harassment of Jon had me in stitches. :)"

2,7,A Man Without Honor,I keep feeling that the girl who plays Dany (Emily Clarke or something) is just a week actress compared to everybody else in the series it is starting to affect my enjoyment of here scenes.

2,7,A Man Without Honor,"All everyone wants out of this episode anyways is to hear ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"""

[Speculation](/g ""I think the handling of Bran and Rickon's death was very poorly done. I don't think any of the viewers truly believe that they are dead. It was way too telegraphed. Frist Bran mentions the orphan boys, then Rickon, then they actually SHOW them running about. Come on, no one is falling for this. They should have just shown the lot of them heading to the mill and that's it. Also, I would have had Theon put some fake pelts on the bodies to help sell it. In the book Bran and Rickon disappear and we don't get another chapter from Bran until the very end. So it is much more believable.

2,7,A Man Without Honor,"I haven't read the books, so while many may know the answer for a fact I'm just looking for an answer to this from the show's perspective:

Do we know those burned bodies were the Stark boys? Couldn't they have been the kids of that other family in the farm, or someone else?"

2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Did anyone else feel the scene between Jaime and Cleos went on way too long? I know they were trying to do some character development, but that was ridiculous. The first time Ive been bored while watching the show.
"
2,7,A Man Without Honor,"Best part of episodes like this is always the non-readers reactions. Give me your tears!

Is it just me, or did Gergor (I assume that was him with Tywin?) seem too... intelligent? I've always pictured him as being barely able to hold a coherent conversation, but he didn't seem that bad at it in this episode.

So glad they decided to make Danys story not-completely boring. I still cringe whenever they skip over to her, but at least stuff is actually happening now.

2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"I have to say, this episode really changed my opinion of the actress playing Asha/Yara, I previously found her lackluster, but I think she did a fantastic job on this episode.

2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"I always thought Lena was a little stiff playing Cersei who, by the way, is my favorite character in the books. Such a great villain. 

But tonight I was really pleased with how she did the Tyrion scene. I loved the way she put her hand to her mouth to barely hide the evil smirk she wore when Tyrion turned away from the whore. And did anyone notice the way Cersei was sitting when Tyrion was apologizing to the woman? She was, like, leaning in the arm of the chair as if she were watching some great play. Mockingly, of course. She cared nothing for the emotion between her brother and the woman.

2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"Spoiler free recap (sorry I'm a bit late and this will probably go mostly unnoticed, but no harm done): 

So this episode wrapped up pretty much all of the build up to the coming important events. Stannis is invading, Daenerys is heading to the House of the Undying, Tywin and the bulk of his host has left Harrenhal to march to King's Landing in an attempt to defend it, **Stannis is invading**. The only thing standing between the characters central to these events acting them out is the rest of the week. They did a very good job showing just how imminent these events are (they did an especially good job bringing Stannis' attack on Kings Landing back to the forefront and I feel they did a very good job emphasizing how significant it is). 

At the same time, they've begun some of the (could be a spoiler but I really don't think it's revealing much at all) important story arcs for next season and beyond. Jaime and Brienne are off on their travels. Bronn, Rickon, Osha and Hodor are basically dead to the world. Roose Bolton's Bastard is now free to try and reclaim Winterfell from the Ironborn for the North. Robb has forsaken the marriage promise/essential strategic pact with the Freys. Arya/Hot Pie/Gendry have escaped Harrenhal. Jon Snow and Halfhand are now captives of Mance Rayder's wildlings, and are on the way to see the King-Beyond-the-Wall himself. Sam made an interesting find of dragonglass/obsidian weapons and a strange horn...bundled together by a Nights Watch cape. I'm liking how they're introducing these new story arcs in episode 8 instead of the finale. Most shows tend to introduce arcs which will be focused on in the subsequent season in the season finale or even next season's premier. I'm thinking this will allow the creators to get us much more involved in these arcs by the finale, and end this season on some really well-done and crazy cliffhangers, getting us much more excited for next season. 

All in all, in terms of overall plot progression, this episode was forced to balance the very thin line between build up and execution of the main plot points of this season. And it did a very good job. As I said, this episode also introduced the early beginnings/gave a brief glimpse of a decent amount of the important arcs of next season. The episode could have spent no more than 15-20 min tops explaining this plot advancement and dedicated the remaining ~40 min to starting the events. Instead, they drew this explanation out throughout the entirety of the episode, and intercut it with some extremely well-done, revealing and just plain entertaining character development/interaction. We definitely had some of the overall best development/interaction scenes this episode; Tyrion+Varys+Bronn, Tyrion+Varys, Tyrion+Bronn, Tyrion+Cersei, Robb+Roose, Arya+Jaqen, Tyrion+Shae, Dany+Jorah...there really wasn't a single character interaction/development scene that was unnecessary at all. As it stands, the high majority of the next/last 2 hours of this season will be, without revealing too much, unbelievably mind-blowing/crazy/satisfactory/awesome for readers and non-readers alike. 

I foresee anyone on edge/slightly disappointed with the season so far is going to have a rather sudden and extreme change of mind. The readers will have one of their biggest worries addressed, and will almost certainly come out with their hopes satisfied as best as possible. The non-readers will be treated to a series of extremely mind-blowing, awesome, fulfilling events. Readers--our expectations and hopes will soon be met and very likely surpassed. Non-readers--I hope you're prepared to sit down, buckle up and have a fresh change of underwear/pants ready. "

But, I will admit, I'm hoping - somehow - we'll still get [CoK Spoiler](/b ""Weasel Soup."")"
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,I can't believe they took out Jaqun's best scene.

2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"Karstark offering his heart to the Father? WTF. Why not ""the gods"" That just proves to me that the writers aren't the fans of the books that they claim to be.

2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,It is my ritual to listen to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KABvPbq-U) and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ5-vgFSQQs) at max volume 3 times before the show. If that doesn't get you pumped to watch game of fuckin' thrones something is wrong with you.
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,Jamie and Brienne yes. :) . I love their part in the books.
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"""Above average intelligence."""
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,That threat is on record.

2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,I wonder how they intend to do the entire battle in one episode
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"y'know the week doesn't normally go slow when waiting for another episode. after that preview, it's gonna take forever "
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"That preview for next week's episode.  Holy shit.  I already know what happens, but I'll still be dying a slow death waiting all week.  Looks like one of those ""epic moments in TV history"" kinda deals."
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"[ACoK Spoiler](/b ""So I'm guessing there's no chain for the battle next episode?"")"
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,Sleeping Hodor reminds me of Snorlax
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"There are only two episodes left. :(

That next episode will surely be the best this season!"
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,I feel like all the changes with Jon and Arya aren't helping their characters at all.
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"> ""There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance of beating me in a fair fight.""

Who do everyone think these three men are?"
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,I think it's about time they mentioned the weird fuckin' food in Westeros. Lamprey Pie ftw. I think I remember a stoat stuffed with tons of crap or something like that
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"Oona Chaplin...hottest girl in this series, IMO."
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"Wow this episode is blowing my mind.  Generic comment, I know, but holy bajeebus."
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,Dat cache
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"As a reader, one thing I have come to accept is that this is most definitely A Game of Thrones, not A Clash of Kings"
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,I feel like the deviations from the book are ruining some of the best moments that I have read. The creators of the show are not as creative as G.R.R.M in my honest opinion and the show loses a lot because of it.
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"I just loved the Tyrion - Bronn - Varys scenes - the quarrel about the name of the Maester who wrote the Book about the great sieges of Westeros really made me laugh out loud
These three should get much more screentime together"
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,was it me or was it kind of awkward in the sex scene when not-jayne is naked and she is *still* trying to get robb naked is a bit drawn out 
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"I'm really disappointed they didn't give Arya her Harrenhal kill. That line at the end about the rain and the blood... one of my favorite moments in the whole series. Although, I did [AFFC spoiler] (/b ""like Cersei's line about Joffrey and Myrcella. They're probably foreshadowing the Maggy prophecy; she really sounds like she thinks Tyrion is the valonqar."")"
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,The last scene had me grinning so much. Fuckin' love Bran.
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"I love the random fact about the Volantene slave tattoos. It's a minor aside from the most recent book and a nice little nod to book readers.

Otherwise this episode is all set up and almost no pay-off and thus a little frustrating to watch. It would have been the perfect opportunity to set up  Tyrion's [Clash Spoiler](/b ""chain""), Jon's [Clash Spoiler](/b ""battle with the Halfhand"") or even just Dany [Clash Spoiler](/b ""finally meeting Quaithe, let alone go to the House of the Undying"").

There's some good character moments for Arya, Varys, Tyrion adn Davos, but otherwise I kind of liked this a little less than previous episodes. Who knows, it might just be the Clash of Expectation and Reality. "
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,I'm a bit sad there was no slapping of the Joffrey this week! Can't wait for next week!
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,[deleted]
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"Overall, not one of my fav episodes. I think it just sums up what I am not liking as much for this season. I will reiterate what others have already brought up.

I understand needing to make changes for screen. I even understand wanting to add some non-canon stuff for people like Robb, Tywin, etc. But what I don't get is why change things that don't NEED to be changed? Why Talisa instead of Jeyne? I don't get it. Does she need to be more interesting? I mean, I am pretty sure Jeyne must be interesting in order to have captured Robb's heart.

Arya should have [CoK](/b ""slit that guard's throat. That was a huge step in her character's development. Hoping something is made of it down the road here, perhaps in Valar Morghulis."")

Anyway, still super happy to even have a show, of course. Just disappointed with some of the changes going on."
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,I got a quick question. I have not yet read the book but is that horn that the nights watch guys find pretty important? Looked important haha Just wondering.
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"[Speculation](/g ""I just re-watched the Jon scenes from the last episode, didn't pick up on it the first time that Qhorin doesn't mean it when he attacks Jon, he's trying to make it look like he doesn't trust him anymore so they'll believe him when he sides with Mance. Assuming, of course, that Jon picks up on this "")"
2,8,The Prince of Winterfell,"Question. Why don't the men of the nights watch wear hats?!? They're in a taiga/permafrost biome, so it would be absurd not to. Maybe its supposed to indicate that they are not as able and knowledgable as the wildlings- who all have hoods and hats."
2,9,Blackwater,"If that wasn't the most badass ""I quit"" speech I don't know what is."
2,9,Blackwater,">Rains of Castemere at the ending

2,9,Blackwater,"Oh man...Stannis's rampage on the walls of King's Landing.

Now THAT'S a king, motherfucker."

2,9,Blackwater,Time to empty the puke barrel...
2,9,Blackwater,"""Screw you guys. I'm going home"" - Sandor Clegane"
2,9,Blackwater,"One cool thing about the episode is that the doll which Sansa keeps looking at in her room is actually a callback to a previous scene.

It's the same doll given to her by Ned Stark, in Season 1, as a present. She responds to his present by saying that she ""hasn't played with dolls since she was six.""

The whole scene in 2.09 is about Sansa realizing how stupid she had been (to be angered by Ned's kindness), and how wonderful her world was before Joffrey took over."
2,9,Blackwater,That drum beat was funkier than I would imagine. It was fabulous.

2,9,Blackwater,I love how Joffrey's an unredemptive fucking pussy.
2,9,Blackwater,"Bronn singing Rains of Castamere was amazing, especially with the actor's history as a pop singer."
2,9,Blackwater,"HBO's format is better than Hollywood's. 10-12 hour-long episodes tell a better story than a 2 hour CGI-fest. Also, the way their shows' budgets work forces them to rely on writing and acting and actual artistic value rather than their budget and CGI."
2,9,Blackwater,Who needs a chain when you've got wildfire like that? That was stunning.
2,9,Blackwater,Drunk Cersei is the perfect blend of creepy and sinister.

2,9,Blackwater,Sansa with an EPIC burn!
2,9,Blackwater,"Do you guys think they'll throw in a little [ACOK](/b """"Renly's Ghost"""") to play with viewers minds kind of like the book did?"
2,9,Blackwater,The dialogue between Sandor and Sansa was really incredible commentary on the grey morality that ASOIAF does so well with.

RIP Davos Seaworth, the Onion Knight!"
2,9,Blackwater,"Hey guys, remember the ninth episode of last season? That was fun.

2,9,Blackwater,"Why do none of these people have helmets? Stannis, the Hound, Lancel... Are they out of their minds?"
2,9,Blackwater,"Cersei reminds me of the drunk aunt that keeps on talking and talking and talking.

While most of us would just smile and nod, Sansa chooses to be surprised. 

EDIT: :39, confirming that Cersei is still being a drunk aunt.

:57, confirming that Cersei is crazy. "
2,9,Blackwater,"""Hundreds will die!""

""........thousands"""
2,9,Blackwater,"Holy Fuck,

That version of the Rains of Castamere by The National worked perfectly for the credits."
2,9,Blackwater,I think the Cersei/Sansa character study is *almost* more interesting than the battle. Almost. The battle is extremely well orchestrated considering they do not have a massive budget. 
2,9,Blackwater,"not looking good for stan ""the man"" baratheon"
2,9,Blackwater,"""These are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them!"" Tyrion... still a badass."
2,9,Blackwater,"For bookreaders, they introduced Ser Mandon Moore and ~~Podrick Payne~~ last episode, too. Pod was revealed prior.

EDIT: It appears Ser Mandon Moore of the Kingsguard canonically made an attempt on Tyrion's life, only to be killed by Podrick Payne. Our sour jerk Ser Meryn Trant did not filled this plot event in."
2,9,Blackwater,"I have to say, this was easily the best episode of the entire season."
2,9,Blackwater,Will GRRM please write all of the episodes?
2,9,Blackwater,I couldn't help but think of the lion king during Cersei's speech to Tommen...
2,9,Blackwater,Sandor Clegane. Fuck yes. 
2,9,Blackwater,"Best line goes to Tyrion: [ASOS](/b """"Weddings."" Heh"")"

2,9,Blackwater,"OHHH FUCK ME. - best delivered line of the season, hands down"
2,9,Blackwater,"I like all the Cersei exposition. Makes her seem just as batshit crazy as she is in the books, about to poison her son and all."
2,9,Blackwater,"""Any man dies with a clean sword, and i'll rape his fucking corpse!""

Holy shit, that was awesome"
2,9,Blackwater,"Even though I want to see the Lannister having their asses handed to them, I loved the episode. Cersei was OUTSTANDING, and I hope Tyrion survives... right? That freaked me out a bit. Also Bronn and Sandor rocked. I'm still pumped with adrenaline... I love this show <3"
2,9,Blackwater,Fucking Joffrey. Tyrion's a better leader than him in his sleep.
2,9,Blackwater,I'm really happy that they gave Sandor plenty of screen time
2,9,Blackwater,"Holy fuck

E: Referring to the Wyldfire and the arrow from Bronn that started it all. But also towards the whole episode. **Holy fuck.**"
2,9,Blackwater,"""The worst ones always live""

That should be the tagline for ASOIAF."
2,9,Blackwater,Anyone know that what song they used at the end credits?
2,9,Blackwater,Holy Mother of god the wildfire looks awesome.
2,9,Blackwater,"""LOOK AT ME."" yes. "
2,9,Blackwater,"The ending with Cersei and Tommen sitting the Iron Throne was fantastic. I loved it. The entire thing - the parallel of Cersei sitting upon it with Jaime sitting upon it during the siege of King's Landing years ago, the focus given to Tommen, the reveal of Loras Tyrell, and then - of course - the song. Been waiting for the Rains of Castamere ever since the show premiered. What a treat to see it all unfold onscreen!

Also, Tyrion's Hand chain! He finally wore it! I got insanely excited as soon as I saw that little costuming detail."
2,9,Blackwater,I want to say just how much I LOVED the Lannister soldiers and Bronn singing The Rains of Castamere.
2,9,Blackwater,[deleted]
2,9,Blackwater,Is...is he dead?
2,9,Blackwater,"I was REALLY worried that the wildfire was going to come off as cheesy, but man they nailed the SFX on that one. Great episode."
2,9,Blackwater,"This episode better be so bloody awesome that the news of it's epicness spreads like wildfire all over the net. 

We have a naval battle/siege, shots of the hound fighting viciously, Tyrion's rousing remark, fire arrows in the night, some shots of Sansa and Cersei along with Illyn Payne and Joffery getting scared shitless. On top of all that we have assume to hear the Rains of Castemere sometime during the episode. So much potential for awesome and fantastic feast on the eyes and ears. 

I'll sell my nose to get this episode right now for viewing purposes. "
2,9,Blackwater,"And now, a new generation of Sansa / Sandor shippers are born. Men and women alike will fall under a new banner. A new party. A party of mass hysterics and illogic. "
2,9,Blackwater,"> Fuck the king.

Mmmm quite. "
2,9,Blackwater,HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.

2,9,Blackwater,"Okay, I knew it was going to be good... but HOLY SHIT. Can we have George R.R. Martin write *all* the episodes from now on?! :D

Where do I even begin? So much to talk about... I'm just gonna try and hit on the points that come to me. I guess I can start by saying, the pacing of everything was just spot-on. It all felt fluid and real, the whole battle. From prelude to epilogue, it almost feels like you're there in the city with them. 

The wildfire bit was astounding, and just as horrible as I imagined it to be. The carnage, bathing everything and everyone in an eerie green light, and the agonizing screams that continued long after the fire went out. The look on Davos' face. It's haunting... and Joffrey's reaction on the battlements was, admittedly, to be expected at this point, but jesus what a sadist. 

However, that moment right before he retreats to the castle, where we see some conflict on his face, was *great*. They humanized him for a second, and I feel like we got to see the ""boy"" in the boy king, that we'd known from earlier in season 1. He wants to help his people, to inspire them, to be a *good king*... and then he ditches XD
Still, a nice moment.

So, Sansa. She was brilliant this week. It's really amazing how these actors and actresses are able to bring the characters to life like this. At this point, there is *no distinction* for me between book-Sansa and tv-Sansa. They're one in the same. Likewise for Cersei, the ""magnificent queen"". Haha, we really get to see past all her armor tonight *(not past her new physical armor, however. Too strong, haha)*. 

Her constant wine-drinking and the scene with Tommen in the throne room was so good, followed of course by Tywin's *badass* entrance with the Rains of Castamere playing in the background. 

I'm rambling, sorry. But one last thing: I really think the sound department for this show needs all the awards and congratulations we can give. Especially in this episode, it really stands out. If you've got a chance to rewatch, I'd urge you to just sit and *listen* to the world that they've built. 

The rumble of the drums, the hissing of the wildfire. The low roar of distant crashing and combat outside the barred doors, while the immense throne room sleeps silent as a crypt. It's beautiful.



Hey HBO, and everyone involved... I know we've still not had our finale, but *thank you*. *Thank you* for bringing the books to life like this. Television will never be the same after this. Hell, *MOVIES* won't be the same after this series is finished!

All eyes on you, HBO."
2,9,Blackwater,I'm calling it. Tonight's episode is going to be better than any episode we have seen yet.
2,9,Blackwater,"I've said that I think a lot of people will be on this sub complaining about how ""disappointed"" they are with the battle of the Blackwater, and they probably still will. But after seeing the trailers for this week I really do think we're in for something the likes of which have never been seen on a television show. I cannot wait.

[Episode 9 Speculation](/g ""The chain has almost certainly been omitted for the sake of simplicity. A lot of people have complained that it's important because it shows how clever Tyrion in. To that I would just say that every scene Tyrion is in shows how clever he is (the exception being scenes with Shae). It doesn't really need to be reinforced at this point. Tonight is about battle!"")"
2,9,Blackwater,"Does anyone have audio of Bronn and his gang singing Rains? I know the Credits roll is on youtube.

Edit: as per posting policy I strictly mean via youtube or hosted on HBO."
2,9,Blackwater,Stannis can't be captured. No. I refuse to believe it.
2,9,Blackwater,I fucking love Charles Dance's Tywin. On screen for less than 20 seconds and still as imposing as fuck.
2,9,Blackwater,"""Those are brave men knocking at our door; Let's go kill them!"" - Tyrion Lannister.

That had such power but still such a tremble in his voice. He might be fearless but when he's in battle he is afraid like every other man. That is what I like about Tyrion. Is a badass but still human. 

(Sorry if I got the quote wrong)

"
2,9,Blackwater,"Oh man, I'm shaking. This was my favorite episode so far. Even as a book reader I'm just in awe.

""If any man dies with a clean sword I'll rape his fucking corpse!"" - The Hound

EDIT: Not sure who I'm digging more this episode, the Hound or Tyrion. Such a fierce battle being waged in my mind"
2,9,Blackwater,I am so unbelievably jacked up for this episode.
2,9,Blackwater,Stannis is a BAMF.
2,9,Blackwater,Bronn vs. the Hound... now that would be a fight to see.
2,9,Blackwater,Talk to the Hand!
2,9,Blackwater,"Hands down, best episode of the series so far..."
2,9,Blackwater,"As awesome as The Hound, Bronn, and of course Tyrion were this episode, I think Stannis gets the badass achievement award here; watching him be the first on the line and charging in like a beast was amazing. "
2,9,Blackwater,"Don't care how pathetic this sounds...I am still in shock, 30 mins later.  Just floored.  Frozen.  Blown away and a million other descriptors.

That is the most flawlessly-executed episode of television I have ever seen.  Any series.  Ever."
2,9,Blackwater,*WELL WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO TYRION!? GREG SPEENNCCCEE!!!!!*
2,9,Blackwater,Cersei and her golden bra armor. LOL
2,9,Blackwater,Best episode of television ever? Possibly. Record for most people cut in half in one episode of television ever? Definitely. Halfman!
2,9,Blackwater,"Jack Gleeson rocked as Joffrey. I haven't disliked a performance so...liked to dislike a performa... disliked liking ... oh, THWI. Gleeson nailed the character from the book brilliantly. The episode was brilliant. [Book Spoiler](/b ""Wish I'd seen the chains, but writing a scene is cheaper than filming it""). "
2,9,Blackwater,"I'm not sure if this is supposed to be obvious or not, but why exactly did the Hound have that dramatic change of heart? 

I know he is afraid of fire (cuz of his brother), so did the man on fire that came charging at him just freak him out and take the fight out of him?

Or as he said, did he just realize Joffrey's kind of an ass so fuck the king

Or did he just have an epiphany about the morals of killing people... Or did I just completly miss the point? "
2,9,Blackwater,"""Fuck you guys, I'm going home.""- The Hound"
2,9,Blackwater,The Rains of Castamere was AWESOME!
2,9,Blackwater,"I am SHAKING like a leaf after that episode. That...was....brilliant. Just...incredible. Wow. WOW. WOW WOWOWOWOWOWOW.

I can't even put it into word... that was incredible.

Also..my favourite parts were Tyrions (of course)- but not any specific line. It's the look of anguish and conflict on his face as he ordered the attacks. When he saw Stannis' fleet go up in wyldfire he didn't look exultant or happy- he was shocked at the brevity of his plans, his machinations, his scheming had done. That as he sat in a room, all comfortable like, plotting military tactics he saw the actual real effect it had. The devestation he wrought, and he fully realized how powerful and terrible he was at that moment. And I think he hated it, he hated it. 
When he gave the speech to the men, ""Fight for your houses, your gold and your women! There are brave men out there...let's go kill them.""

That moment on his face, that millisecond of twisted grief, conflict and momentary flicker of jubilation was incredible. Peter Dinklage is the finest actor to ever grace our screens. Really, just incredible. I love it, I LOVE THIS SHOW.

OH MAN."
2,9,Blackwater,"So i think i speak for everyone when i say:

2,9,Blackwater,Stannis is a boss.  First man on the field and first man up the wall.
2,9,Blackwater,"Thoughts on tonight's episode

- Well, it was just about perfect. I'd actually give it a 10 - strongest episode of the season. It didn't touch on anything outside of King's Landing, and that's how the Battle of Blackwater should have been done.

- The wildfire was incredibly well done. Just spectacular.

- Very glad that Ser Mandon Moore made it into the show (and he was just introduced last episode?) I would have hated for it to be something random that hurt Tyrion. Pod was the shit too.

- Showing ""Renly"" fighting and then revealing it to be Loras was excellent. Despite me hating the Lannisters, seeing Tywin charge in was really badass

- Of all the scenes the show has created so far, Tywin's and Arya's have been the strongest. However, that little dialogue between Bronn and the Hound tonight was FUCKING AWESOME.

- Stannis was the mannis, and when he cleaved that dude's head in half - holy shit

- I loved seeing the Hound's sheer terror about the fire. They captured that well. It broke him, the hardest man in King's Landing. His ""fuck everything"" speech - amazing

- The show didn't have any of the other characters around Westeros, and it did not suffer in the slightest. No Dany? No problem. This was a welcome change of pace for what is the most important event in book 2

- This episode mirrors last year's ""Baelor"" in which Ned dies, and I think that was obviously the most climactic episode of season 1 - and it got a perfect score. Season 2 has easily matched, if not upped, the ante

- Will we see [CoK Spoiler](/b ""The Bastard of Bolton seize Winterfell next week, even concealed by armor, and smash Theon's face?"")

- Bummed out we only have one episode left, but ... Valar Morghulis

"
2,9,Blackwater,"The Hound in tonight's episode: ""Fire bad. Tree pretty."""
2,9,Blackwater,How fucked are Joffrey and Cersei now that Tywin is there? I think we're going to need to update the slapping gif.
2,9,Blackwater,"I am very interested in what they are going to do with Bronn's character.

They set up a very interesting foil between Bronn and Sandor Clegane. Clegane, despite saying that ""killing is the sweetest thing there is,"" has a little bit too much during the fighting and the fire and has a dramatic change of character. Then you have Bronn who just killed hundreds if not thousands of people with a single arrow. I wonder what's going to happen to him. I would be disappointed if they do not show how the aftermath of the battle affects Bronn."

2,9,Blackwater,"Just finished watching. Great episode. Thoughts;

*Wow, those swords are sharp. Cutting through limbs like carving a cake.

*So Loras is wearing Renly's armors. Guess we won't be seeing much of the other Tyrell siblings.

*Love that Stannis actually fought in the battle. I haven't liked Stephen Dillane in this season as much as I have now.

*Dat wildfire, Dat National playing the Rains of Castamere.

*All in all, pretty darn happy. I'm just as pissed as I was when the battle ended in the book!"

2,9,Blackwater,[deleted]
2,9,Blackwater,"I'm really hoping Joffrey gets slapped or worse tonight. That would make this a great day.

2,9,Blackwater,"As a reader I just want to say how happy I am that they stayed very true to the books. 

The wildfire, Tyrion's ride/sneak attack, Ser Mandon Moore's betrayal, the timely arrival of the Lannisters *and* the Tyrells who I thought they'd cut also, the fact the Renly deception was there also.

**AND DON'T FORGET THAT MOTHERFUCKING EXPLOSION!!!!**"
2,9,Blackwater,"Everytime the hound hacked someone in twain I shouted ""holy fucking shit!"" "
2,9,Blackwater,Saving Ser Ryan
2,9,Blackwater,I totally lost it when I realized the final scene with Cersei and Tommen was being underscored by The Rains of Castamere. Fucking brilliant. 
2,9,Blackwater,"All in all I think this episode was done brilliantly. I was skeptical as to whether or not they could pull the battle off in a single episode and keep all the important parts in, but as far as I know they've managed that almost flawlessly. Since most of it has already been said, I'll list what I was most impressed with.

- Bronn and Sandor. They make good rivals. I especially like how big the Hound talks right up until he takes off. Also, that most of what he said can be quoted.

- Cersei's drunken lapse. Well played. Well said. Keeping Tommen for the battle was also very well done. The scene on the throne was made so moving with his presence.

- Sansa. Just in general. Since this season we've seen Sansa change in demeanor, I felt this episode was excellent at showing that she'd also grown as a character. She, of all, has changed the most, I feel.

- Can we all take a second to give Ramin Djawadi the recognition he deserves. It hit me this episode that the haunting new theme which plays almost every episode this season is The Rains of Castamere. On a re-watch, go back and listen to every time it occurs and tell me it is not apt. His other themes have also been brilliant, but I was especially pleased with this one.

Oh, but I can be nit-picky though. Shall I be nit-picky? Please let me be nit-picky. Here is what I have to say by ways of nit-picking:


- Firstly I didn't find it was very clear that it was a member of the kingsguard who cut Tyrion down. I supposed that moment's pause while they acknowledge each other serves to demonstrate Tyrion's trust in his comrade, but to me it seemed like they were both just stopping for not much of a reason. Perhaps Instead of the random who stole the kill between the two men, the assailant could have done it himself.

- Renly's ghost. I saw it; however I feel it was thrown in as an homage to the event in the book, rather than emphasising it as an event in the show. It wouldn't have been very hard to emphaise at that. One or two shots of Loras in Renly's armour and maybe someone to pose the question 'Is that Renly?' would have created a whole different feeling in the seconds between the entering of Tywin's army and meeting Cersei. Plus you could sneak in that weird confusion/disbelief that came forth when Renly was mentioned in the books. Or else even Cersei could have got in a 'Renly?' before Loras removed his helm.

- I was really wanting the chain. All in all I'm not disappointed it was left out, I just think it would have shown Tyrion to be more that just brilliant at thinking in a straightforward manner. But most of his speech and actions all series have done that for him so I will just have to get over that one."
2,9,Blackwater,RIP Onion...

2,9,Blackwater,"[Some of my favorite shots/moments](http://imgur.com/a/8i7sx)

I hate to use the word but ""epic"" episode seems appropriate."
2,9,Blackwater,"I have to say, in my opinion, not only was last night's episode the best episode of the series thus far, I think it was one of the best episodes of modern television I have seen. As an avid reader of the books, I was highly concerned that they would have trouble filming the magnitude of awesomeness that is the Battle of the Blackwater. However, they fuckin' nailed it. "
2,9,Blackwater,"Speculation time!  Who gets to kill Stannis?  He didn't die in the battle, right?  So he was taken alive, and  pretty boy Loras is there, probably with the sole goal of killing him himself.  Meanwhile, Brienne is on her way there too for a prisoner exchange where she expects to get 2 Stark girls for one Lannister man, and if she finds out Stannis is there, she'll want to kill him herself.

I'm hoping to see either a rematch between Brienne and Loras, fighting for the honor of killing Stannis, OR Brienne making a deal with the Lannisters; they get Jaime back, she gets Sansa and gets to kill Stannis.

This presumably ends the engagement between Sansa and Joffrey, much to everyone's relief, and frees up Joffrey to marry Margaery,
who might be better able to handle that little shit.  Then when Sansa gets safely home, she can marry one of Lord Frey's sons to free Robb from his obligations, and then she can quietly drift away off camera."

2,9,Blackwater,"In my opinion. To call this the best of the season would be a disservice, it is easily the best the show has produced thus far and quite frankly one of the most exhilarating, action-packed, and masterfully acted and written episodes of television I've ever seen. Its scope rivals the LOTR movies, there I've said it."

2,10,Valar Morghulis,"A few thoughts:

* Yep, Robb and his mother are idiots at this game.

* The Arya and Jaqen scene was perfect, exactly what I was missing in Episode 8.

* The burning of Winterfell was bleak but exactly what the series needed.  I'm glad they left it the same as the books. Theon and Maester Luwin were wonderful.

* Did TV viewers understand the deal between Jon and Qorin Halfhand?  'Cause it really looked like Jon just murdered Quorin for no reason in the show.

* The House of the Undying was a bit short.  I thought the whole point of it was forshadowing for the next few books, but they didn't really show much.

* So some of the Khalasar is still alive?  And they kill Xaro Xhoan Daxos and take his stuff to pay for the boats?  I don't really like the changes they made.  Xaro wasn't such a bad guy.

* So many wights, so early on?  I thought they didn't come in 'til about a quarter in to the next book.

Why was Winterfell sacked? How the hell did the 20 Ironborn just burn whatever they want while there was an army outside of the gates? They knocked out Theon and then they said ""let's go home"" but when Bran and Rickon came out all of Winterfell was burned?

2,10,Valar Morghulis,"Question! **Who burned down Winterfell?** 

It looked like Theon's soldiers surrendered, which means that the place would have been turned over to the troops loyal to Robb Stark. So how come everyone had been butchered and everything burned?"
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"They should have had Pyat Pree say: ""Always the door to the right and always up the stai- .... oh, fuck it. Just go wherever you want."""
2,10,Valar Morghulis,Tyrion's appreciation for being loved made this dude cry. I love you too little buddy.
2,10,Valar Morghulis,Hodor nailed it.
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"I enjoyed how they gave more insight into Theon's thoughts and reflections on taking Winterfell. Theon's in a truly difficult position, he could betray the house that raised him, or join his biological family. 

He was never truly a member of the Stark house, and was very aware he was merely a tool for peace and a prisoner that happened to be raised as a ward. He has much anger over never being in the family and an outcast while growing up. So with one family keeping him at arms distance, I'm not surprised he jumped at the chance to try and be part of his biological family. But even they rebuff him, claiming him not truly ""Iron born"" and more of a Wolf hostage then a Greyjoy leader. 

So he's stuck. Loyalty to Starks would be mostly out of Stolkholm syndrome, and loyalty to Pyke is met with indifference from his father. Theon was in control of nothing is whole life, and being a 19 year old young man with no family  accepting him would lead to rash behaviors. I'm not agreeing with what he did, and he kind of his a dick in the books, but I do pity him as a character. "
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"[THIS](http://imgur.com/LHwmJ) realization hit me like a lightning bolt last night. Am I the only one that felt this from their conversation? For some reason it never sunk in when I read the books, but I think this is a fair assessment. Thanks to the someone else that posted the bottom two screen caps in a different imgur picture!

2,10,Valar Morghulis,"""Three horns... oh shit  RUN""
I had gotten the chills at that part. "
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"I'm confused about 2 things.

First off, in episode 9 we see that Sansa is about to leave kings landing with the mountain. And yet in episode 10 she is there at court.

Secondly, Winterfell is apparently surrounded by 500 northerners, and yet after the Iron Islanders leave the place is empty again and apparently they have to leave because ""they might be back""... what??"
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"Inspiring battle speech from Theon.

Before he gets knocked out.

Also, is Jaqen dead or actually just faceless (or even another guy)? Arya did name more then one person to escape, and I think somehow Jaqen has to pay the ""extra"" price. (He looked serious when he wants to be unnamed, I doubt he can just kill extra people without any sort of consequence).

And who was the other woman who got pushed into the vault along with Xaro? Are the Dothraki tribe people technically still alive? 

Also, the final scene was awesome. "
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"So the plot line with Bran and Rickon left me kind of confused. What transpired exactly between Theon getting knocked out and the city getting burned, who burned it the Islanders or the siege party, and more importantly where the heck did the siege envoy go? Wasn't it their job to find and recover the stark boys and bring them back to their camp? "
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"For those of you who are upset about the House of the Undying. I implore you, how could they have possibly done anything remotely similar to the books. Cast a [aCoK](/b ""Rhaegar"")? Spoil the [ASOS](/b ""Red Wedding"") The ambiguity of the visions is what makes the so powerful, and in this medium, its just not plausible. I for one LOVED Dany going to the throne room, to the wall, to the tent. Thought it was brilliant.

The sack of Winterfell was beautifully shot. The scene of the four of them walking away as the castle burns is terrific. I agree though, that its a bit unclear as to what actually happened. Was it the ironborn or [aCoK](/b ""Ramsay"")?

The Brienne/Jaime scene was pitch perfect. Were those [ASOS](/b ""Brotherhood"")?

I could care less if Robb Stark worships the Seven. He's more Tully than Stark.

Loved the sword choreography in Jon v. Qhorin. I think Jon's true intent was sufficiently clear.

Summer, Shaggy, Rhaegar, Drogon, and Viseryon all looked beautiful.

Joff does a nice job of setting up the KL plot for SOS. And Tywin motherfucking Lannister.

I thought last week that Dinklage had his emmy speech during the whole ""lets go kill them"" moment. His moment with Shae was some of the finest acting all season, along with Cersei in Maegor's, Bran and Arya every time they are on screen, and Stannis the Mannis during his moment with Mel tonight.

And then theres the fist. I had hoped they would end the season on the third blast. I enjoyed the way they reminded the viewers what the blasts meant. I thought the far shots of the Wights/Others looked great, slowly meandering zombie winter apocolypse. Then there was the White Walker. Idk, I'll have to take another look. Not evil enough, or something. Maybe its just their mystery is a little spoiled.

Nevertheless, the real winner of the finale was the production. The pacing, the cinematography, the score. Just brilliant.
"
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"As a book reader, I kind of feel like they mishandled the House of the Undying. For all of Dany's reluctance and useless words of bravery (If they wanted you dead, they'd have killed you already, idiot), it resulted in (to me) a ""wow it's fucking nothing"" moment. I guess it'll give Dany some closure with Drogo, but I never cared about that, and the burnt out Red Keep isn't much of a prediction. The visions in the book are much more fascinating than anything they've shown. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan of the show (dem undead special effects) but they wasted three segments of her story with her dragging her feet about going, and she finally goes and nothing really happens. Perhaps they should have saved the budget they spent on Veep and just used it all on GOT.

Jaqen doing his thing was a nice moment to wait for, I was anticipating the entire time.

I understand why they changed the Battle of Winterfell (if that's the correct title for the skirmish). [ASOS](/b ""They're clearly trying to keep the Bolton betrayal a secret until the RW."") Also money, but for once its likely not the primary reason. Kinda bummed to see Maester Luwin go though, I felt like the actor did a really good job for a limited role.

Can't wait for next season though!"

2,10,Valar Morghulis,"This has been bugging me.  How could Daenerys possibly just strut into Xaro Xhoan Daxos's place, kill him, and loot the place?  I recall the scene before she was allowed into Qarth.  How many people where with her? 50?  How many warriors?  20?  Then there is the scene where you see the aftermath of the dragon theft, it seems like her entire entourage is slaughtered.  Later on, before she enters the House of the Undying, it shows her with Jorah and one other Dothraki.  At this point, I am completely under the impression that that it is all the man power she has left.  But, nope, she follows it up with storming Daxos's manor with a new horde of followers.

I can understand that, TV being TV, her original khalasar was dwindled due to availability of extras but even if Daenerys has a Dothraki warrior generator, Daxos’s place should be impossible to crack.  He was the richest guy in Qarth, probably just got ~12 times richer, and considering his recent political actions, he should have an entire army of guards.  If not, then his lack of caution is uncharacteristic and mind blowing.

The entire scene I was in total disbelief.  So, am I missing something?  Maybe some details from the books?  Does she torch her way in?  It seems like the pint sized dragons have warlock burning power, but not enough to eradicate a city guard.

2,10,Valar Morghulis,Game of Thrones: the only show where a close up of a horse shitting raises no questions
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"So we had dragons, we had dragons setting shit on fire, we had the awesome face of a white walker, and other white shots of white walkers. I feel like a ton of funding went in to this episode."
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"The White Walker was just...wow!

I'm walking around randomly squeaking from the residual excitement."
2,10,Valar Morghulis,House of the Undying sucked monkey arse IMO.
2,10,Valar Morghulis,IS STANNIS GONNA HAVE TO CHOKE A BITCH?????
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"As a non-book reader (I'm almost done with AGoT), I was excited to find out what The House of the Undying was all about as soon as The Warlock appeared in Qarth.  Couple that with all the cool things I've heard about Jaqen, and the fallout from Blackwater, and this promises to be an EPIC season finale.  "
2,10,Valar Morghulis,I like Margery's character in the show better than the book. I anticipate that she will fit into coming drama very nicely.
2,10,Valar Morghulis,maybe i'm missing something but why doesn't sansa go back to winterfell?
2,10,Valar Morghulis,Brienne kicking some ASS! 
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"Well, that's totally out of character for Brienne, you know, murdering an unarmed man on his back."
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"Alfie Allen, there you go making me feel sorry for Theon again. Dude deserves a Golden Globe or something, simply for making Theon sympathetic."
2,10,Valar Morghulis,OH DAGMAR YOU CAR... never mind.
2,10,Valar Morghulis,Bran barrow nice.
2,10,Valar Morghulis,did GoT just pass up an opportunity to show gore? whaaaaaat?
2,10,Valar Morghulis,... what is going on? Where are the real visions? 
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"Well, one more year of shitting myself waiting for a new season.

Better break out the adult diapers"
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"i've not read the books, but im just wondering if there is a reason why stannis baratheon didn't use the ""smoke assassin"" against joffrey as he did against renly baratheon. anyone care to chime in?"
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"I could bitch about House of the Undying, or the timeline/scale of the Fist of the First Men.

I'm going to choose to acknowledge, instead, that the sack of Winterfell and Tyrion sequences just made me emotional as fuck, particularly the former.  So job well done, D&D."
2,10,Valar Morghulis,Hodor :'(
2,10,Valar Morghulis,Can anyone tell me what happened to the hound after episode 9? 
2,10,Valar Morghulis,Theon and that fucking horn. So great.
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"Wish Arya had got to ""use her coin"" with the guards as she did in the books."
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"[Unfounded speculation based entirely off show](/g ""When the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. When the rivers run dry. When the mountains blow like leaves in the wind. Maybe it's a metaphor? When Gregor Clegane is routed in battle/killed. When Riverrun closes the sluice gate and dries the moat (maybe they ally with Daenerys? Maybe she murders them all?) When... when... I forget whose sigil is the sun. Then the Targaryans take the throne? Or Daenerys dies? I dunno, I'm not even done with ACOK, so tag them spoilers with the right books if you got answers."")"
2,10,Valar Morghulis,I was hoping for the surprise appearance of a certain bastard.
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"The end with the three horn blasts, I had to stop for a second and compose myself"
2,10,Valar Morghulis,Those White Walkers were fucking creepy.
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"I've come to the conclusion that if you like any characters other than Joffrey, Cersei, or Tywin, you're gonna have a bad time."
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"As a non-reader this may be a stupid question, but why was Winterfell burnt down? Weren't there ""500 men"" defending it? "
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"When Theon Greyjoy gives his speech, Winterfell is surrounded by northeners. After Osha and the kids get out, they see the town burnt and no armies anywhere...please explain where have they gone? The iron islanders and the northeners?"
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"Theon Theory:
I was speaking with my colleague and we have confirmed that we both are questioning the people outside the gates. Our theory is that, this was a test to Theon. We we wondering, how come we never got to see who was actually outside the gates and why bag Theon's head? I think that this was to see how much of his iron blood was still in him. 
I am not asking for confirmation from the book readers, but just noting something I picked up on and theorized with a colleague. "
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"In the end you could say

*shades*

Winter**fell**"
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"Am I the only one around here who is unsure who they want to ""win"".........Robb,Dany,Tyrion,The Walkers???"
2,10,Valar Morghulis,"I'm real late to this discussion...but i can't even begin to explain my emotions about how bad ass Tyrion (SP?) was in this and the last episode. I was so pumped to see him be a bad ass, so sad to see him almost get killed, and even sadder to see how they are treating him...even thought it was pretty much his doing that saved them :/"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I can't believe it, thousands of years and the Wall comes down through the power of friendship."
2,11,King Hot Pie,R + L = J confirmed! Jaqen really is Littlefinger and Roz's son!
2,11,King Hot Pie,I can't believe Joffrey stepped down as king for Stannis after Maury presented the paternity test.
2,11,King Hot Pie,It's about time Howland Reed showed up and proved the Merling theory.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I know it's HBO, but was it really necessary to show a close up of Varys's ""genitals"" for 45 seconds?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,I did not know Stannis could dance so well.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Wow Benjen Stark was Mance Rayder the whole time.
WAT
DA 
FAK"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Anyone else think it was a little out of character for Hot Pie to sack King's Landing, and then out of nowhere name Samwell Tarly (had they even *met*?) Hand of the King?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I think Gregor Clegane's redemption arc was really well done, especially the scene where he saves the Hound's life and they make amends for their childhood (their hug was adorable, anyone have a screen cap?), but I didn't quite buy his romance subplot with Catelyn. Did she really get over Ned that quickly in the books? :/ "
2,11,King Hot Pie,So THAT'S why they added Roz to the show. Now it all makes sense.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Hodor deserves an emmy for his performance in this episode. The precision, life, and meaning put into his final speech before his hodorian army sacked king's landing was truly phenomenal."
2,11,King Hot Pie,[deleted]
2,11,King Hot Pie,"FUCK YES! Literally screamed in joy when it was revealed Syrio was a Faceless Man posing as Ser Meryn and assassinated Cersei. Wtf was with that sex scene between Dagmer and Roose Bolton's bastard, though? Was that part of the thing involving Theon? didn't need to see that :/ "
2,11,King Hot Pie,I think I just upvoted this entire thread. Also I am now crying of laughter in a public library. Fuck you reddit.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Let's face it, none of us expected John Arryn to behead Joffrey"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"To be honest, I thought having that scene where Ned's bones performed a jazz dance routine in front of the Iron Throne was a bit distasteful."
2,11,King Hot Pie,"The final scene where we saw the heads of Robb Stark, Joffrey and Stannis on pikes was chilling. Then the jumpcut to the Iron Throne where both Melisandre and Margaery sat at either side naked and in collared chain leashes each gripped by fierce hands. 

When it finally panned up to reveal the grinning man covered in blood and faded to black and all we heard was ""Hodor"" and a menacing maniacal laugh - I knew things just got hella serious for next season."
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Sweet Robin is Azor Azai! Knew it!

Also, the scene where the hound buggered varys was weird."
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Wow.  I did not expect the ""Melisandre is a man"" reveal.

No wonder Davos was so shocked during the shadow birth.

Edit: Also, DAE think that the Salladhor Saan x Cersei scene was a bit overdone?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"OMG the wildfire attack turned Davo's remaining hair and beard GREEN? The Green Onion Knight cometh? OK I guess I understand how that could work... but who is this Green God that he's all going on about, now? "
2,11,King Hot Pie,The scene where Hodor and Xaro Xhoan Daxos sumo wrestled was amazing. 
2,11,King Hot Pie,AM I THE ONLY ONE EXCITED TO SEE EDDARD STARK BACK ALIVE??
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I love the bit where Tyion retires to his room, alone, then takes off his shoes to reveal that he's been walking on his knees the entire time. The sound he makes as he stretches his legs and stands up to 7 feet tall was wonderful.

And that was wonderfully contrasted to the scene where Bronn gets his lower legs cut off only to reveal they're fake, and that he's the dwarf."
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I literally cried when Hot Pie spoke ""Valar Morghulis"" and revealed himself to actually be Hodor. Literally, it was like being fucked in the brain."
2,11,King Hot Pie,I loved the bit where Dany went to Westeros.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"something I didn't like, though: Ros is Jon Snow's mother? ugh. okay. that means that scene back from season one where Jon tells Sam how he almost lost his virginity... he almost fucked his mother? what's with this show and incest, ffs"
2,11,King Hot Pie,I still can't believe that GRRM made a cameo disguised as Hodor.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Was I the only one that teared up at the touching scene where Varys punted Rickons dog off the wall of Kings Landing? I mean we all saw it coming, but I had to look away at some point... RIP :("
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Stannis: ""One fetus, please.""

Employee: ""Uhmm... this is a McDonald's...""

Stannis: ""Alrighty then, one McFetus please.""

BEST. LINE. EVER."
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I thought it was crazy when Ulfric Stormcloak was the leader of the group that sacked Winterfell, and not [ASoS](/b ""Edmure Tully"")."
2,11,King Hot Pie,They're really stepping into the future by making this an HBO GO-only special.
2,11,King Hot Pie,I really want to take this entire thread and write an episode where all of this happens. If I can find the time to do it this week... I may.
2,11,King Hot Pie,Jorah finally got some from Dany? That man deserves a medal for what he went through.
2,11,King Hot Pie,The Sandor-Gregor-Greatjon-Hodor gang-bang scene was WEIRD. Was that in the books?
2,11,King Hot Pie,It blew my mind when I found out that this was just a group of really dedicated LARP'ers!
2,11,King Hot Pie,"> See this post

> Get all excited because I thought last week was the finale

> Start looking for a torrent

> Can't find one

> Come back and read comments

> Fuck you guys"
2,11,King Hot Pie,I just knew Brienne and Jaime would hook up. Beneath those dead women though..
2,11,King Hot Pie,I can't believe they killed off Arya. That was hard to watch.
2,11,King Hot Pie,I cant believe yara was carrying Theron's baby the whole time
2,11,King Hot Pie,Am I the only one thinking the actors did a great job? But their CGI-budget was pretty low this time.
2,11,King Hot Pie,Tywin's wedding was the best part of the show. His wedding gown was just beautiful. 
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I'm not a book reader, so would it be possible to clarify exactly what happened at the end with all the Tywin clones? It was never explained where they came from, nor why the all had such vast moobs."
2,11,King Hot Pie,"So can we finally confirm [Speculation](/g ""R+L=mc^2"")?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I don't like how they handled the sex change scene, tbh. 

It was much more subtle in the book. I sort of knew what to expect when Tywin walked into the room with a howler monkey, a vat of butter, and a razor. Pretty disappointing. "
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Oh man, they're really starting to deviate from the books."
2,11,King Hot Pie,That dialogue between Hodor and Ser Pounce... breathtaking.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Benjen Stark OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE!! 

Was he riding a fucking KRAKEN?!?!"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"the best part was when Sam joined forces with the white walkers and opened a childrens orphanage in Qwuart called ""Little White's""."
2,11,King Hot Pie,Why did Tyrion become a pornstar again ? Someone explain? 
2,11,King Hot Pie,Rhaegar's body being used as a host for the Great Other? Who knew? 
2,11,King Hot Pie,Oh you dirty bitches... You nearly had me there for a second. How dare you play with my emotions! 
2,11,King Hot Pie,The atmosphere at the party where Hot Pie served those rather *stark* pies was really ominous.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I was a bit distracted when the episode was airing so I have to ask, what was it that Brienne shouted when she and Jamie woke up next to each other?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,Syrio was Ja'qen Hagar's father?!?!?!! Awesome.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Wow, thanks Reddit for making me search for half an hour online for this; probably the only troll thread I've ever seen on Reddit but goddamn this is good."
2,11,King Hot Pie,My only question is what were Chevy Chase and Walter White doing with Eddard's sword?
2,11,King Hot Pie,"If I were GRRM, I'd come to this topic and just spoil the end. No one would ever know."
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I loved the cross-over with the video game Skyrim, where Robb Stark was revealed to be the Dovakin and used his Thu'um to blow Joffry off the top of the red keep"
2,11,King Hot Pie,The part I didn't see coming is where Benjen returned leading the Thundercats to destroy the others. I kind've saw the whole Mance Rayder being Jon's mother thing from a mile away.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Seven hells, for a sec you guys had me all excited. Now I'm just sad. "
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Too many moments of awesome:

- the one thing (well, 3 things) the Eyrie had no defense against. ""impregnable"" is now ""extra crispy""

- I nearly broke my DVR rewinding the white spider scene. The wings and feelers reminded me of Lovecraft's ""mi-go""

- kind of shocking to find out Catelyn is shaved. I think Littlefinger died a happy man"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I'll buy dragons at the end of season 1, but now vampires for the season 2 finale?!?! WTF HBO??"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Incredible thread mod. 

10/10 would read again "
2,11,King Hot Pie,"So, who else guessed Jaqen was Nymeria in disguise? "
2,11,King Hot Pie,I liked the part where Joffrey was a dick 
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Wow, who knew J+J=HP?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,Yo I knew this shit was gonna happen since day 1.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Whoa, the dragons can TALK?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,I TOLD YOU BERIC DONDARRION WAS SANSA WITH A FAKE BEARD.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Finally, Lady Catelyn sex scene. Game of Thrones was in lack of MILF scenes, unlike Spartacus."
2,11,King Hot Pie,My favorite part was when King Hot Pie knighted everyone in armor just to prove Gendry wrong. That was like the craziest twist.  
2,11,King Hot Pie,The fuck? Why did Danaerys turn into a Dragon?
2,11,King Hot Pie,You are despicable. 
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Is it just me or are there waaaay too many penises in this episode. 

Good lord."
2,11,King Hot Pie,The custard-pie throwing scene was just how I imagined it would be ...
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Finally, some conformation that Jaqen was secretly Eddard all along!

I can't believe that they had him just kill Robb like that though...not how that scene happend in the books at all."
2,11,King Hot Pie,If only the White Walkers had known their biggest weakness was Iron Thrones.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I was really glad they showed what happened in Xaro's vault, because Doreah was one of my favorite characters."
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Part of me loved that the Horn of Jorumund was revealed to be the Sword of Omens, and when Victarion shouts *""MUGETSU""*, channelling the True Source through the crystal blade and brings down the Wall, sailing into the ice on his dragonboats of fire, staring down at the lock of Danearys' hair with a single manly tear running down his face... Would've been awesome except that Littlefinger threw him out the moon door, just as he did to Catelyn at Havelock Vetinari and Sabriel Abhorsen's wedding while they were playing the music of the Star Dance.

Which reminds me, does that mean that Littlefinger is the last remaining Targaryen now? Or are Kylar/Durzo going to go all Slippery John on Pug's ass?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,The part when Tyrion was revealed to be Batman in disguise blew my mind.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"oh my god, a GoT and r/circlejerk hybrid.  this is amazing."
2,11,King Hot Pie,HOT PIE KING IN THE SOUTH!
2,11,King Hot Pie,I was shocked when Salladhor Saan settled for second best after not getting Cersei... once he saw Tywin in that skirt I guess he was the one persuaded.
2,11,King Hot Pie,There's some creepy shadow baby walking around yelling for his mommy.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Jalabar Xho is SUUCH a badass in this one!

"
2,11,King Hot Pie,I'm so happy that they didn't cut out Sandor coming back to rescue Sansa and having them declare their secret love for each other
2,11,King Hot Pie,I was in tears when Davos was reunited with his sons in the afterlife and they forgave him.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Hot Pie and Cersei took ""We're in for a bit of rape"" to a whole new level...."
2,11,King Hot Pie,"BAHAHAHA KING ROBERT YOU CARD

Since I missed this yday <.< "
2,11,King Hot Pie,"God, this episode was the best. Pretty sexual though. The acting from Hot Pie was amazing, though. However, I thought the sex scene between him and [S2.E11](/s ""Cersei"") was a bit graphic. I seriously thought she would prohibit the use of an actual sword... God, I hope she's okay. I mean, I never even knew you could put one up there, and that far too.... However, the one between [S2.E11](/s ""Brienne and Jaime"") was hot. Not gonna lie, I so fapped to that.

At least we know now that he has a thing for actual fish, though... I always wanted to try that, but I never had the courage to bring it up to someone =P Bravo for him for acting out his fantasies!"
2,11,King Hot Pie,So many battles in this one. They must have spent a fortune on ~~CGI~~ costuming.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"The Jojen/Meera sex scene was a bit much, but if you watch the scene closely you can see Raff the Sweetling in the background masturbating,  it makes a lot of sense now. "
2,11,King Hot Pie,Stannis is an auror and Jon Snow is an animorph
2,11,King Hot Pie,"TECHNICALLY, THIS EPISODE IS STILL TO AIR. No wonder piracy is such an issue. "
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Pardon my ignorance, but I'm very confused. What is this?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,Loved the scene where Tyrion wanted to grab some scented oils for a midnight wank and accidentally used some wildfire! 
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I liked when Tyrion spoke his last words ""The needs of the many, out weight the needs of the sober."" "
2,11,King Hot Pie,I'm so confused... what is this?  What is everyone talking about  :/
2,11,King Hot Pie,They're setting it up so everyone is dead except Ros...fucking Ros...
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Was anyone else expecting a tie in to Star wars because i sure as hell didnt. Dont see why Vader had to force choke Ghost though, i would have prefered Joffrey."
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I can't believe Dany would do that, and with Hot Pie! It really gives Sam, the new Hand of the King, some hope."
2,11,King Hot Pie,Why didn't she use the time warp to age her dragons instead? She could have taken over the fucking world. Especially since the dragons fused into blue/green/black/red eyes ultimate dragon.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I loved the scene with Tyrion, Tywin, typewriters and tax returns. "
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I had to shut it off when I found out that Hodor is the heir to the throne. I mean, when Cersei led the throne room in a ""All hail King Hodor"" chant....hold on, i think i need a second."
2,11,King Hot Pie,I have to say that I did not expect George RR Martin's cameo as the King of the Mountain Dwarves.  He really nailed it!  So glad he'll be such a player in season 3.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Anyone else find it a little unrealistic how easily Patchface and Moon Boy were able to dispatch that army of White Walkers? I mean, everything has a weakness, but humor and bad singing? "
2,11,King Hot Pie,I was NOT expecting that pine comb to come out of Littlefinger's ass!
2,11,King Hot Pie,Mordr and Lysa! Ugh!
2,11,King Hot Pie,I just got exponentially more sad. Thanks a lot.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I have to say, after all the discussion about famous versus unknown actors, casting Wayne Brady as Victarion was an inspired choice."
2,11,King Hot Pie,I think they went a bit away from the books when team rocket showed up and tried to steal the dragons
2,11,King Hot Pie,I hate all of you. That is all.
2,11,King Hot Pie,Okay im confused. Wat?
2,11,King Hot Pie,I'm so confused by this thread.
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Seriously, fuck you guys.


At least a Ygritte nudie scene wasn't the top comment."
2,11,King Hot Pie,Fuck you reddit.
2,11,King Hot Pie,This thread is about as useful as nipples on a breastplate.
2,11,King Hot Pie,I didn't expect Rickon to reveal he's the fabled faceless child. It was pretty cool when he [suddenly killed The Hound and Bronn](/spoiler)
2,11,King Hot Pie,"More tits and now a close up of her bush? Come on, HBO, the gratuitous nudity is a little much in this episode, even for Game of Thrones."
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Tywin is Captain Picard and Sandor and Sandor is Worf. Best plot twist ever, and HBO pulled it off perfectly 

I really love how the White Walkers are just Borg and Daleks di8sguised as mythical creatures. Can;t wait for Littlefinger to reveal himself as the Doctor next week "
2,11,King Hot Pie,ಠ_ಠ thought I missed a episode. have shame fallen on all your houses?
2,11,King Hot Pie,"wait what? 11 episodes?

i thought there were 10

edit: didn't know i could go from excited to upset so fast"
2,11,King Hot Pie,Hodor's monologue made me cry.
2,11,King Hot Pie,oh my god my sides
2,11,King Hot Pie,Did anyone else squeal when Reek and Ramsay kissed?
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Just a fucking outstanding job here, my imagination is cashed at the moment but thanks(and upvotes) for all those who could make me laugh so mightily. "
2,11,King Hot Pie,This is the most confusing thread I have ever laid my eyes on.
2,11,King Hot Pie,[deleted]
2,11,King Hot Pie,"wait there is one more season 2 episode? i thought the season ended with the 2.10 ?!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_Thrones_episodes

wiki also says there is no 11"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I don't get it, which episode is this?!"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I flipped my shit when Theon was revealed to be the father of all the kids in westeros,"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"First I was like ""wtf...""

then I was [like](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120522023856/mlp/images/1/16/OH_YOU.jpg)."
2,11,King Hot Pie,ITT: Circlejerk
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I thought the scene where Hodor strips naked, flys to King's Landing, and anoints himself grandmaester was the most surprising turn of events in the entire season. "
2,11,King Hot Pie,What 
2,11,King Hot Pie,[deleted]
2,11,King Hot Pie,I was dissapointed that the budget cuts made them change the filming location to Walmart
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Crazy how the new continent was actually Lordran and Gwyn, Lord of Cinder took over the throne!"
2,11,King Hot Pie,[Spoliers All](/b Jaqen H'Ghar is every character!)
2,11,King Hot Pie,umm episode 11!?

2,11,King Hot Pie,[deleted]
2,11,King Hot Pie,[deleted]
2,11,King Hot Pie,"Was I the only one surprised that [2.11](/s ""Hodor Hodor Hodor"")"
2,11,King Hot Pie,ok this is gonna be completely n00besque but where the hell is this 4 and a half hour long episode?? ive looked on hbo and cant find it anywhere
2,11,King Hot Pie,I don't get the title... was there an episode 11? 
2,11,King Hot Pie,"episode 11? what i don't get it. i thought they ended the season on episode 10. 

Can someone explain this to me please?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,[deleted]
2,11,King Hot Pie,...
2,11,King Hot Pie,"What the fuck are you people talking about, the season ended last week?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I didn't even know there was an episode 11
"
2,11,King Hot Pie,"How did you see episode 11, I thought season 2 was over?"
2,11,King Hot Pie,There was an 11th episode? I'm totally clueless right now. Can someone fill me in?
2,11,King Hot Pie,"I feel, heavily confused at the moment. I think reddit is just fucking with me, but I can't be sure."
2,11,King Hot Pie,This episode hasn't aired... can somebody explain??
2,11,King Hot Pie,is there an episode 11? isn't valar morghulis(ep. 10) the season finale?
2,11,King Hot Pie,Dat sex scene!!!
2,11,King Hot Pie,"i cant seem to find it. :(
anyone can post a link for me?

edit

3,1,Valar Dohaeris,Stannis is so stonefaced I thought my stream had frozen for a second.
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,Winterfell is smoldering in the opening sequence.  Pretty cool little detail.
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,Poor Tyrion just wants to toss the ball with dad.
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,First scene of next ep: Joffrey flings all the Flea Bottom orphans over the walls with catapults

3,1,Valar Dohaeris,Oh damn Cersei is pissed she's not the hot one anymore.
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,Fucking hell Tywin. They did an amazing job of that scene. 
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,Damn Tywin. He was nicer to Arya.
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"""As useless as nipples on an Unsullied"""
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,All yall motherfuckers are missing the best bit. When Davos doesnt know who the boat is loyal to and STILL tells the fucking truth. All man baby. All man.

3,1,Valar Dohaeris,That was not long enough. I DEMAND MORE!
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"The Tyrion Tywin scene near took my breath away. Just perfect, Charles Dance's calm yet harsh rejection, and Peter Dinklage looking like he nearly lost it. Bravo."

3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"- Roose Bolton is a hard man

- I loved how the dragons looked. Drogon looked really cool - very spiny, scaled, menacing even as an infant (teenager?)

- The Barristan Selmy reveal was not expected but was handled well

- The warlock girl trying to assassinate Dany - added for the show? I know there's a Sorrowful Man somewhere in the story, but I feel like this replaced it

- Good episode over all. It was too damn short!"

3,1,Valar Dohaeris,I like how they spent last season making Tywin more likable with the added scenes with Arya. Then in his first scene of the season they undo all of it by having him be horrible to Tyrion.

Also jorah you're not supposed to recognize him!"
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,Did no one else notice Littlefinger telling Sansa he saw her sister? I guess that means he's either lieing (like always) or he actually noticed when Arya was serving him in Harrenhal.

3,1,Valar Dohaeris,Salladhor Saan gave a pretty convincing argument to Davos about why he should just head out. Stannis's army is depleted and the red priestess is burning people...what made him go back?
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"I loved the theme of strength this episode. We see two different ideas of strength battling it out: Tywin, Cersei, and the army slave trainer all believe strength comes from lack of compassion and never showing you care. These people already have power and ""strength."" Standing opposite are Tyrion, Margaery, and Daenerys who may go on to prove that compassion for other human beings gives them the will to battle ahead and the support to do so. Great episode."

[Spoilers SoS #1](#b "">Mance: I was a crow(member of the nights watch) when you were no bigger than the babe in Dalla’s(His woman) belly, Jon Snow. So take care not to play tricksy with me."")

[Spoilers SoS #2](#b "">Mance: I promised you a tale before, of how I knew you. Have you puzzled it out yet?"")

[Spoilers SoS #3](#b "">Jon: No, I knew your face. I’ve seen it before. Twice.
*It made no sense at first, but as Jon turned it over in his mind, dawn broke. When you were a brother of the Watch . . .*"")

[Spoilers SoS #4](#b "">Mance: Very good! Yes, that was the first time. You were just a boy, and I was all in black, one of a dozen riding escort to old Lord Commander Qorgyle when he came down to see your father at Winterfell. I was walking the wall around the yard when I came on you and your brother Robb. It had snowed the night before, and the two of you had built a great mountain above the gate and were waiting for someone likely to pass underneath."")

[Spoilers SoS #5](#b "">Jon: But you said you saw me twice. When was the other time?"")

[Spoilers SoS #6](#b "">Mance: When King Robert came to Winterfell to make your father Hand. When your father learned the king was coming, he sent word to his brother Benjen on the Wall, so he might come down for the
feast. There is more commerce between the black brothers and the free folk than you know, and soon enough word came to my ears as well. It was too choice a chance to resist. Your uncle did not know me by sight, so I had no fear from that quarter, and I did not think your father was like to remember a young crow he’d met briefly years before. I wanted to see this Robert with my own eyes, king to king, and get the measure of your uncle Benjen as well. He was First Ranger by then, and the bane of all my people. So I saddled my fleetest horse, and rode."")

[Spoilers SoS #7](#b "">Mance: *When he was a member of the nights watch* One day on a ranging we brought down a fine big elk. We were skinning it when the smell of blood drew a shadow-cat out of its lair. I drove it off, but not before it shredded my cloak to ribbons. Do you see? Here, here, and here? He chuckled. It shredded my arm and back as well, and I bled worse than the elk. My brothers feared I might die before they got me back to Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower, so they carried me to a wildling village where we knew an old wisewoman did some healing. She was dead, as it happened, but her daughter saw to me. Cleaned my wounds, sewed me up, and fed me porridge and potions until I was strong enough to ride again. And she sewed up the rents in my cloak as well, with some scarlet silk from Asshai that her grandmother had pulled from the wreck of a cog washed up on the Frozen Shore. It was the greatest treasure she had, and her gift to me. He swept the cloak back over his shoulders. But at the Shadow Tower, I was given a new wool cloak from stores, black and black, and trimmed with black, to go with my black breeches and black boots, my black doublet and black mail. The new cloak had
no frays nor rips nor tears . . . and most of all, no red. The men of the Night’s Watch dressed in *black*, Ser Denys Mallister reminded me sternly, as if I had forgotten. My old cloak was fit for burning now, he said. I left the next morning . . . for a place where a kiss was not a crime, and a man could wear any cloak he chose."")

[Spoilers SoS #8](#b "">Jon: *There is only one tale that he might believe.* You say you were at Winterfell, the night my father feasted King Robert."")

You saw them walk the center aisle with every eye upon them and take their seats at the table just below the dais where the king and queen were seated."")

3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"Having read the books, I was slightly angered when Jon Snow is talking to Mance Rayder and Snow's justification for why he wants to join the Wildlings is based off of a desire to fight the Others.

Jon Snow and Mance's exchange missed so many great lines its sickening.

**Qhorin was my enemy.  But also my brother, once.  So ... shall I thank you for killing him, Jon Snow? Or curse you?.**

**You ought to thank me for killing your enemy and curse me for killing your friend.**

That was a very important line and I would rather have seen that line included in exchange for Bronn's face in the loincloth of whore #127.

"
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,THE KING IN THE MOTHRFUCKIN NORTH! HELL YEAH!
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,I'll never not love this intro.
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,I thought the reason that Jon Snow gave to Mance for betraying the Watch in the books was much more important/compelling/believable than the whole fighting for the living thing.

YES!"
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"Returning to the series after many many months, I am instantly struck again by how _fucking sexy_ basically the entire cast is.

3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"This episode was clearly designed to 'set up' the plot lines for the season. That's why it jumped around so much and just touched on everyone. I didn't like it that much, but I expect the rest of the season to step it up. It's just hard to make a show with so many different plot lines."

3,1,Valar Dohaeris,the flayed man on Bolton's armor is perfect. the little things in this show make it near perfect
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"I loved it. I loved seeing everyone and progressing and the scenes were so great that I can't control my grammar. However,
I don't understand my feels.
Maybe I just built it up too much, but I feel empty. Unsatisfied. 
It was really good, but I was expecting amazing.
None of my friends have seen the episode yet, so I'm turning to Reddit to see if I'm the only one who feels like something was missing.
It was good. I loved it. I missed everyone and I'm so excited it's back, but I can't help but feel like something a little bigger should have happened. "
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,hey its gaius julius ceaser!
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"Really small detail, but the flayed man sigil is so sick in the show."
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"Was anyone else as pumped as I was to see them giving alot of time to Bronn?  The actor is great and the scenes with him are always entertaining.
"
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"""Charitable work"". Almost like it was a new phrase to him. Great delivery in that scene."
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"I think my only disappointment was the Selmy reveal... They take the whole book of getting to know him before you know it's Selmy and the reveal in the book was one of my favorite parts of the whole series...  But I can understand why they did it right away in the show.

Best part was when Tyrion turned as Tywin through in that jab about the whore.  Gave me chills.

"
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"""If you should die, I'll let your wife carry your bones around her neck:"" great reference"
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,Awesome damn way to start the season! I have to say I was a tad bit disappointed that Mance wasn't singing or playing a lute when Jon was talking to Tormund.  Every other bit was fucking brilliant thou.
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"I know they weren't following the books with Ser Barristan, but man I still got goosebumps when he announced himself to Dany"
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"The one big flaw for me was that they had this big lead up to a showdown with the Others in last season, but never showed the actual battle with the Night's Watch."
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"The Selmy reveal was stupid. I understand that you can't trick the viewers like that as easly in TV as you can in a book, but the other characters at least shouldn't be aware. It cuts out the possibility of a major character arc change later on for no good reason."

3,1,Valar Dohaeris,feels good to be back. 
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,That was such an epic episode! Going to be a great season. 
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,There are some notable differences between the book & show but I actually like this! We truly do not know what to expect. I know it's disappointing not seeing how we imagined the books word for word and some of our favorite scenes in the book are left out. It's not going to be perfect. I still thought it was a very good season premiere and I am eagerly waiting for next weeks episode.  
3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"For the most part, it was awesome.

But who leaves Season 2 on the cliffhanger of the Battle of the Fist...and then skips over the Battle? So unsatisfied."

3,1,Valar Dohaeris,"What was more cringe worthy?:

**1.** When the Lannisters tortured the Northmen with rats in buckets in Season 2

**2.** When the slave trader cut the nipple of that guy off.

3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","What a fantastic episode tonight. Last week was good, but this week was great. My thoughts:

- I loved the introduction of Jojen and Meera Reed. They look different than I expected (older, bigger Jojen), but I already love Jojen.

- The Queen of Thorns - wow. She's perfect

- Catelyn's story about Jon Snow and the pox was a nice touch, I don't remember it from SoS but its been awhile.

- *THEON!* What a treat to see him so soon.

- The introduction of Warging was done well. The necessary expository dialogue wasn't too much. Orell, super cool. Fist of the First men...(shivers)

- When I heard the talk of Bastard of Bolton, I got chills. I didn't expect that [DwD](#b ""We would see 'Boy' so soon. I'm really fired up."")

- Dolorous Edd: ""Aye, We left you. You're fat, and you're slow. We didn't want to die."" (Shrug). Hilarious

- Thoros of Myr, so happy to see you. He's excellent already

- The Jaime and Brienne fight was good, but I don't know if it conveyed the danger and urgency that I felt in the book. Still good though.

- On the Robb front, two scenes were particularly important: [SoS](#b ""Bolton once again interrupting Robb and Talisa. Does this guy think that Robb does anything except romance his lady? And of course, Karstark's speech to him about the wedding. Doesn't get any more heavy on the foreshadowing..."")

3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","A few random thoughts.

1.  NCJ & GC are just perfect for Jaime & Brienne.

2.  I feel like the storylines they're going to change most for the sake of the TV series are Bran's and Dany's.  Also, Bran, meet puberty, huh?

3.  Gendry going off on Arya for wasting her three kills was some great fan service.

4.  Not that it's really much different from the book version, but this show really plays up the S&M side of Joffrey, huh?  I half expect Joff to commission the sex toy manufacturer from Se7en.

5.  Show is also doing a great job playing up the Tyrells, and their potency.  As a reader, their prominence kinda surprised me a bit come AFFC, so it's good for TV-only crowd that they're planting the seeds now.

6.  Also clearly setting up [SPOILERS ASOS](#b ""Tyrion & Sansa"").

7.  I like little things like maintaining the same actor for Rast, despite him not appearing in S2 (I think?).  That stuff adds up, IMO.

8.  [Roose Change Theory](#g ""Even more examples of Talisa, who supposedly was not highborn, wearing gloves and looking quite highborn, if you want to play around with Roose Change.  I guess some of the horseback difficulties may counter that, but could have been a show, as it was right in front of Catelyn"")

9.  Thoughts on making Catelyn sympathetic to Jon?"

3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",God damn the episode is almost over.
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",no dragons and khaleesi....treachery 
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","I'm still wondering where these 'longer episodes' are. They were talking early on about how each episode was about 5 minutes longer than before such that it adds up to an extra episode by the end of the season.

edit: I just checked on previous episode lengths. Most are 53 to 54 minutes, so a 58 to 59 minute episode IS longer, though the episodes so far are 55 and 57 minutes."
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","As a book reader, I am happily confused."

3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Joffery was getting a hard on at the idea of Margery killing something.
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",love the new joffery/magaery plot line they added in. Its stuff like this that makes watching the show a delight for someone who read the book

3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",is anyone else starting to feel like Joffery is becoming less of a cunt?  Seems like Margery is starting to soften him a bit maybe.  That or it is just he is always next to his mother who is an even bigger cunt

3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",I know this will get a lot of hate but I really disliked some of the dialogues in this episode. Like the part with tyrion and shae sounded very forced to me.
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","Michael Fassbender is absolutely the best part of Prometheus. If the whole movie star thing doesn't pan out, he should be on Game of Thrones! Actually, why not both?"
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Is Prometheus like an Alien prequel or something? Sorry for the irrelevence but I'm just sitting here waiting for GOT and I'm kinda wierded out by the ending.
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Predictions: Arya does something cool. Bran has dreams again. Margarie and Sansa become bffs. John's last name is pronounced Snoauh. Robb ignores Catelyn's advice. Tyrion says something witty. Dany gets attacked again. Cercie is still a cunt (and we all know there's no cure for that).

3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Holy shit next week is when things start getting crazy.
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Lemony lemony lemon cakes!
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","Nice episode. You could tell that Jaime being in jail for too long really put him at a disadvantage, though chances are he would've lost anyway.

Also... poor Theon. He may have done bad stuff, but gods is he in for it now. :(

And the Queen of Thorns was awesome. :D"
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",loved the callback to the pilot in Bran's dream
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",I'm really digging the casting for Jojen and Meera!
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","I loved Anguy in the books, he is perfect in the show. "
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","Gods damn, I love this show!"
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Slicing nipples off...knives under fingernails...what will episode 3 bring?
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",the Thoros of Myr in my head is now on the show.  Perfect actor for the part.
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",Can we agree that the scene with Thoros of Myr is one of the best so far in the series? 
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","What's Theon's story?

Didn't he escape Winterfell at the end of last season?"
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","Can someone clarify for me why Cat and Robb are wondering where Bran and Rickon are? In the books and I THOUGHT in the show, when Theon hung those kids in their place to prove his dumbass point everyone believed them to be dead at that point, including Cat and Robb. I thought I remembered a scene where they learned about them being hung by Theon at Winterfell... so when did they suddenly start believing otherwise? What did I miss?"
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","Wonderful episode. A lot of great moments from the Game of Thrones ladies.

* I love Catlyn and Cersei. Their goals are so different, yet because they are both mothers, so many things about them align. You can see how much it grieves them to be away from their children. Catlyn can't even see hers, Cersei is being pushed away from her little boy. They both are also losing control - they no longer exert the power they once had. Both prisoners to their sons. 
*I was really concerned about how Margaery was being portrayed in the previous season since it seemed so different from her character in the book. This season is awesome though, and she's really turning out how I had hoped. She knows exactly what she's doing, not at all phased by Sansa's confession that her future husband is a monster. This woman can take care of herself. I suspect grandma taught her well.
* I feel so bad for Sansa. You see how everyone is gathering to protect her, yet you have a feeling if Margaery were in the same position, she'd figure a way out of it. Sansa is just so innocent.
*Brienne is friggin awesome. 
"
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","The stream just stopped to buffer literally as Tyrion said ""Only if you stop."" Well played, internet, well played."
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","The Queen of Thorns, brilliant."
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","Non book reader here. I don't know if its just the series or not but Joffrey, to me, comes off as in-the-closet. Especially in this episode. He seemed very interested when Margery mentioned anal, and in a homophobic way brushed off how his uncle was a ""degenerate."" In other episodes I've noticed this as well."
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",No one is talking about the john snow sickness thing. That got me sad.
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","[ASOS, seriously] (#b ""Man, they're making/have made Shae into such a more important, likable character (but terrible choice of actress). How are they going to pull off Tyrion strangling her next season without making him look like a complete monster? "")"

3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",I love that gareth keenan is now in this
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","I was very happy with this episode for many reasons, where do I start? The Queen of Thorns is perfect in every way and is going to be great this season to have around, she feels exactly as if she popped out of the book for me. Seeing Jamie and Brienne story line start was also exciting knowing what comes this season, as did seeing the introduction of the Reeds. They both look and feel the part.

Plus all of the acting, lines to the fans, and overall feel of the episode was just down right great. I really have a feeling Season 3 is going to be something special."
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","Seeing as no one's yet mentioned it, i love Catelyn's full mea culpa about how she royally fucked Jon snow's life"
3,2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words","Cat Stark was starting to be awesome. Then we realize she really is terrible. Not as terrible as Joffrey, but that's still pretty fucking terrible. I like the Reeds, the Queen of Thorns, and Thoros, though."

3,3,Walk of Punishment,"Book readers, who is the bad ass who shot the arrow and did the walk away?"
3,3,Walk of Punishment,"Thinking back on it again, the worst part of the ending was the split-second pause. Jaime thought he was in the clear, and BAM. Hand's off, and it takes a little while for him to realise and start screaming.

Brilliant, but chilling acting by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, gotta hand it to him.

Edit- By worst, I don't mean quality wise, I mean ""omgomgomg that was bad"" wise."

Well, what was Theon's new bff calling him the entire time?  ""My Lord.""  Hmmm, makes you wonder."

Maybe its the end of a really long, fucked up week but the opening scene with Jaime *hurt.* It was  like finding your childhood pet shitting and convulsing in the street from being hit by a car or those dreams where you can't call out for help. I was crying when he was wallering around in the mud and Brienne's going nuts from impotent rage.   I though to myself though, *there is no way they could get as much sympathy for Theon as Jaime.* 


Nope. When Theon walks into his room and realizes the score, his crushing defeat was so goddamn lightening real. I was crying again. 

Fun fact from a microbiologist to be  - One third to one half of the weight of poop is bacteria, mostly E Coli which is fucking awful and sometimes deadly. "

3,4,And Now His Watch is Ended,"I love this season so far, and we've had another great one in the books. Commander Mormont will be missed. Some thoughts about tonight's episode:

- The opening scene with Jaime's hand hanging from his neck, what a great touch. A fantastic addition

- So happy we got to hear the origin story of Varys. Such an excellent part of the books and sheds so much light on him. And when he opens the case to reveal the sorcerer? DAMN Varys is a badass.

- ""Prodigies appear in the oddest of places."" Hahaha, the *superb* addition of Podrick the Stud-dick as a TV plot line continues to deliver.

- The Great Sept looked incredible. They did a fantastic job with it, so much more majestic and grand than I expected. 

- Theon's ""redemption speech"" and claiming Ned was superb. And spilling the truth about Bran/Rickon too. What a great job they did making him sympathetic...only to pull the rug out right from under him/us as Boy turns him back in. AWESOME! [DwD](#b ""Now we are getting a glimpse into who Ramsay is! Is there any doubt that this is him? He seemed a little deferential to the men."")

- Tywin Lannister is so well played by Charles Dance. Is there a single scene he has been in that isn't amazing? ""I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are.""

- Margaery is better in the show than she is in the books. Natalie Dormer is fantastic

- Rest in peace Old Bear. The Craster's Keep betrayal and massacre was a heavy scene. Very well done.

- Beric Dondarrion - hell yes. He looks fantastic. I can't believe we have to wait another week for the duel!

- Sandor Clegane absolutely crushed his scene in the cave with the Brotherhood. Right after he belittles half the cave, when Beric tells him that ""It's me you'll fight"" you can see the trepidation in his face. Perfect.

- The Sack of Astapor...Dany brought the heat! Couldn't have done that better.

His glance is piercing, as are the words he says. Amazing acting."

3,4,And Now His Watch is Ended,"That opening scene with Jaime. Damn that was one of the saddest scenes I've seen in a while. Not the type of sad like a death scene but sad in the way of seeing his character go from so high to falling so low and feeling completely weak and vulnerable.

3,4,And Now His Watch is Ended,I knew Dany wouldn't actually give away her dragon! Just didn't know how she was gonna get it back.
3,4,And Now His Watch is Ended,I really liked the scene with Sansa and Margaery.  Everything Margaery said made Sansa seem so much brighter!
3,4,And Now His Watch is Ended,The end scene with the unsullied was... just epic. Everything I could have ever wanted it to be. SO awesome!!!

Of course I would have rather heard Bear and the Maiden Faire, but scary dungeon music works too."
3,4,And Now His Watch is Ended,"So maybe this is trying to add too much ""realism"", but how the hell is Dany gonna feed her army of 8000 Unsullied?  She's like, about to march across desert now to find more soldiers or ships now, right?  And she doesn't seem the type to want to sack local towns and villages."
3,4,And Now His Watch is Ended,"It just hit me: people keep blaming Catelyn for starting the war, but same with logic if Brann had just listened to his mother, none of this would've happened. Well, basically this goes for every decision made in the story."

3,4,And Now His Watch is Ended,Am I the only one who thinks it's so damn sexy when Daenerys speaks High valaryian? Had to keep re-watching the scene! 
3,4,And Now His Watch is Ended,"I don't know if this has been said before,but i have to ask. After watching the episode for the second time, in regards to Littlefinger's list for the ship,don't you think it's too much of a rookie mistake from his part to order two feather beds? i mean, he's better than that."

3,5,Kissed by Fire,Worst part of the week: Sunday 10:00pm
3,5,Kissed by Fire,"After last week's episode, it was going to be a hard act to follow. This episode was good and opened up strong with the Beric/Hound duel. 

Some other thoughts about tonight's episode:

- You know nothing Jon Sno...okay maybe you know something. A great scene done perfectly!

- Robb was a cold blooded badass in his judgment of Rickard Karstark. 

- When Petyr Baelish he tells Sansa that he appreciates her concern, it's just the most dishonest and unsettling ""gratitude"" possible.

- My favorite scene of the week (other than the duel) has to go to Jaime Lannister describing how he killed the Mad King. I loved reading that part, and the actor just nailed it 

- Qyburn was delightfully creepy, just as I pictured him. His eyes seemed to light up with pleasure as he was treating Jaime's stump

- Roose Bolton bringing Jaime to his knees with 10 words...amazing.

- I felt so sorry for Arya when she was pleading with Gendry to stay, poor girl

- I can't wait for next week and the return of Theon and Boy...previews looked super good"

THE ROOSE IS LOOSE

""By what right does the wolf judge the lion""

Robb is an incredible actor who is fleshing out the character 1000x more than the books ever had the chance too.

I LOVE, LOVE what they did with Shireen. For ya'll show-only babbys, the creepy song she was singing were ""prophecies"" from another character, they just made Shireen a far more fleshed out Character, and my god she is the most adorable little thing. 

Jon Snow still knows nothing, and a lot more at the same time

Tywin-Tyrion-Queen of Thorns are three characters that absolutely mesmerize me whenever they come into the scene. Charles Dance is my favorite actor in the show. 

I've been enjoying Danys new arc, she's finally acting like a Queen, and I love the Valyrian. No more ""WHERE MY BOATS AT, WHERE MY DRAGONS AT?""

Maisie Williams is an incredibly talented actress. Her scenes in the last two episodes evoke the most heart-string pulling outside of Jaime. Her pain and sadness is heartbreaking to witness. ""Yeah, but you're alive""

Sandor v Beric was even better than I expected it to be. Clegane is a badass, and I love the new Beric. 

There was not a SINGLE bad scene this episode. One of the best to date. 

Fuck this show gets better and better. "

3,5,Kissed by Fire,"""My name is Jaime!!""

Finally, we can see so clearly why Jaime Lannister is the favorite character for many of us book readers. It's more than that he killed a murderous mad king about to burn everyone.

He's one of the only characters in the whole series with an actual disdain for the game of thrones.  He's a character in line to the wealthiest family and most powerful positions in the kingdom, yet he chose to become a kingsguard and abandon all of it.  He's one of the only characters that is actively willing to remove himself from positions of power.

(and yeah, he still tried to murder Bran -- but that little shit was trespassing)"

* Arya's disappointment in Clegane's trial and Gendry staying with the Brotherhood adding that HotPie already left. Also asking Berric to resurrect Ned.
* Robb's campaign diminishing with half of his forces depleted. He can't control his men.
* Jaime's struggles with reputation as a Lannister, King's Guard, Kingslayer and himself. He's still depressed.
* Sansa going to be married to Tyrion forced by Tywin.

3,5,Kissed by Fire,Shireen is adorable!
3,5,Kissed by Fire,"Jamie, my name is Jamie! "
3,5,Kissed by Fire,Bathtub scene is probably my favorite scene in the entire show. So freaking perfect.
3,5,Kissed by Fire,"Loras, you manwhore!! "
3,5,Kissed by Fire,"Yeah, well fuck you too Tywin."
3,5,Kissed by Fire,Patchface what a beautiful voice you have.....
3,5,Kissed by Fire,"That scene between the Lannisters at the end of this episode was brilliant. The plotting to secure different regions sums up this show and the true tactical movements that come with every deception. How that whole scenario played out; Cersei to Baelish, Baelish getting the guy to use Loras for info, Tywin using that info to outsmart the Tyrells for mass takeover.  Just amazing. Amazing books and an amazing show! "
3,5,Kissed by Fire,"""My children. You have disgraced the Lannister name for too long.""

They're only what you made them, Tywin."

3,5,Kissed by Fire,Tywin is an ass to all his children. What a major douche-canoe.
3,5,Kissed by Fire,Any book readers want to enlighten me if there is any reason Littlefinger's voice is getting progressively deeper and raspier and... more sinister?  I feel like he's just getting more and more devious and now he can't even hide it.

3,5,Kissed by Fire,Is it weird if I kind of hope that N applies to Brienne too?
3,5,Kissed by Fire,I don't think there was a single scene this episode that wasn't amazing.
3,5,Kissed by Fire,Still no Hars or member jokes :(
3,5,Kissed by Fire,So I'm gonna need a gif of what everyone else wants a gif of. 
3,5,Kissed by Fire,Sansa and Tyrion?! Dat contrast
3,5,Kissed by Fire,The way Robb beheaded that Karstark was very in line with the way Ned beheaded the deserter in the first episode. Same form and everything.
3,5,Kissed by Fire,"Something I just realized tonight, help me out:  
Where the fuck is the Greatjon Umber???"
3,5,Kissed by Fire,"Jaime's monologue was what I was most excited for this season.  This was the exact moment in the books where I did a complete 180 on my negative opinion of him.  I hope viewers who kept saying they will always hate Jaime when I told them he was my favorite character, just had their fucking world turned upside down."
3,5,Kissed by Fire,"The ""Why"" behind Jaime's kingslaying was the one thing going into this season I wanted done right.... The show nailed it. "
3,5,Kissed by Fire,Am starting to realize that no matter who going to end up on the Iron Throne in the end he or she is going to be batshit crazy.

3,5,Kissed by Fire,"Anyone able to supply a GIF of the Blackfish punching Karstark? That was seriously the best, and most deserved punch ever. "

I totally my roomates [ASOS](#b ""who had heard about 'the red wedding' that it was the wedding coming up, and it's named after Sansa's hair. They think that's the big thing to happen this season.

3,6,The Climb,I never thought they would actually show him peeling the skin off Theon's finger. That was gruesome.

3,6,The Climb,10/10 would not climb that wall. 
3,6,The Climb,"For those that missed it - Sansa is crying as she watches Littlefinger's ship sail, which was her previously offered means of escape.  And of course she was told about the change in her wedding plans in the previous scene.

3,6,The Climb,"So Gendry is now [ASOS](#b ""Edric Storm""). Intersting to see how that's going to work."
3,6,The Climb,"This interpretation of green dreams is....

...frightening really"

3,6,The Climb,Seeing Sansa crying like that makes me sad.
3,6,The Climb,Loras Tyrell really doesn't play the gay hand very close to his chest.

3,6,The Climb,"I'm really impressed. Normally I hate it when the writers make up stuff that weren't in the books. But I'm really liking this scene with Melisandre, Thoros and Beric. It really adds a lot to all 3 characters. 

I'm gonna be pissed if they kill Gendry though. I hope they just keep him as a prisoner on Dragonstone."

3,6,The Climb,"AHHH THAT LINE

>Only the ladder is real; the climb is all there is"
3,6,The Climb,Did Sansa really just ask if her family would be allowed to attend Joffrey's wedding?
3,6,The Climb,It is after 9 o'clock and this episode hasn't started. I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS INJUSTICE!
3,6,The Climb,"Looking at the scene with Varys and Littlefinger there's crazy foreshadowing in the costuming. Littlefinger in the shadows, in dark colors... Varys in the light, with light clothing... Says a lot without saying anything"
3,6,The Climb,[removed]
3,6,The Climb,Boy they REALLY want us to watch this Liberace movie. 
3,6,The Climb,"I'm happy for Jon and Ygritte, but holy shit that Littlefinger scene was sheer brilliance. "

I think this episode has some of the best lines of the season so far"

3,6,The Climb,Ygritte the dominatrix
3,6,The Climb,"""You staring at my ass Jon Snow?"" I love Ygritte"
3,6,The Climb,No comments on the Roose Bolton scene? Brienne helping Jaime cut his food was great. IMO the best adapted plotline from the series.
3,6,The Climb,Sansa has a serious case of Fruit Blindness.
3,6,The Climb,"""We will meet again""

hollyyy shiit 

Also loved the [AFFC](/b ""Foreshadowing re: ""eyes shutting forever."" So double layered really (Arya goes blind and Arya becomes ""no one""""))"
3,6,The Climb,I'm expecting the climbing the wall scenes to look freaking awesome.
3,6,The Climb,There's a bit of Jaqen's theme playing in the background as Mel leaves Arya
3,6,The Climb,Loras and Sansa have mad chemistry.
3,6,The Climb,I just want to say thanks for these discussions guys. I've lurked this subreddit and these threads since I started watching and it makes the experience that much more enjoyable and you've convinced me to start reading the books. Thanks
3,6,The Climb,That awkward moment when you let go of somebody to die and they didn't die.

3,6,The Climb,Even seeing Cersei's smirk being wiped off in the recap gave me a chub. Justice. 
3,6,The Climb,I think they missed a golden opportunity by not showing Shae and Sansa's simultaneous reaction to Tyrion's news.
3,6,The Climb,Lol Gilly knows more about making a fire than Sam does.
3,6,The Climb,RICKON SPEAKS!!
3,6,The Climb,Wtf Joffrey..
3,6,The Climb,Note to self - Never become a bad investment with Littlefinger.
3,6,The Climb,What are they doing with Gendry?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Noooooo
3,6,The Climb,Did that seem short to anyone? I want another four minutes!
3,6,The Climb,Hold on a minute... There WAS a good ending!
3,6,The Climb,"""Forgive my manners, I don't see many ladies these days""
""Good for the ladies""
Their banter is hilarious"
3,6,The Climb,I would like a transcription of the final littlefinger speech. I was kind of distracted by the shit that was going down hard as he was speaking...
3,6,The Climb,Funny that Tywin is playing the Kingsguard can't have kids card.
3,6,The Climb,Brienne helping Jaime eat. Jaime grabbing her hand to stop her from killing Bolton. I've never shipped them harder.
3,6,The Climb,Joffrey didn't even have to say anything to make us hate him this week. 
3,6,The Climb,I want to see what Sansa will do when she finds out that they plan to marry her to Tyrion. 
3,6,The Climb,All in favour of Jon Snow staying inside the pool instead of climbing the wall say 'aye'.
3,6,The Climb,I can't help but think Tywin Lannister and Littlefinger would be great Sith lords.
3,6,The Climb,"Karstark?

Are these just more mind games, or is this an actual change...? 

EDIT: the former, of course. "
3,6,The Climb,"Jaime: ""I'm afraid I must *incest*."" "

3,6,The Climb,Holy fuck that littlefinger monologue.
3,6,The Climb,The music they're playing over the credits/ending is beautiful.
3,6,The Climb,"Theme of this week's episode: The Stark girls get shit on.

Arya: loses other friend, now truly alone.

Sansa: still not told Loras loves the D, and now has to marry Tyrion.

Sucks to be a Stark.
"
3,6,The Climb,I was totally ok with going a whole episode without Joffery. Damn him and that crossbow in the last five minutes!
3,6,The Climb,I vote Iwon Rheon for the next resurrection of The Master.
3,6,The Climb,I wonder how graphic they're going to get with all the flaying and torturing.
3,6,The Climb,Poor Theon. This guy is getting off on this. 
3,6,The Climb,Wow. They literally broke part of the wall off. 
3,6,The Climb,Haha Shae and Tyrion pretending not to know each other.
3,6,The Climb,"Sansa looks very, grown up."
3,6,The Climb,OK... Does Jon not have Longclaw on him? Wtf?
3,6,The Climb,"So, Littlefinger is pretty much the greatest villain in the series, as far as I'm concerned."
3,6,The Climb,"Am I the only one that wishes that the wardrobe of the highborn characters included more of the house colors?

Kinda like the display that we saw at the tourney of the Hand in the first season. "
3,6,The Climb,"""I'd hoped you learned your lesson about over playing your.............. position""

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ROOSE BOLTON!!!!"
3,6,The Climb,"The ""you haven't learned how to not overplay your.......position"" quip from Roose Bolton was fucking priceless, I literally LOL'ed on that bit."
3,6,The Climb,TIL: There's more than one way to skin a rabbit.
3,6,The Climb,"I LOVE how bolton had a slight pause when he was delivering the ""thought you might overplay your.... position"" line.  nice subtle jab on jaime losing the hand."
3,6,The Climb,I like whenever Arya learns something new (bow skills!) about fighting because I look forward to the day where she is a complete badass.
3,6,The Climb,Am I the only one who got the sense that Orell really fucking enjoyed cutting that rope
3,6,The Climb,Oh c'mon how can she not know he's gay now.
3,6,The Climb,The ship had a mockingbird on it. It was little finger's ship. Not Loras
3,6,The Climb,"So much for my 'Roz the Whore sits the Iron Throne at the end' prediction.
."
3,6,The Climb,Crazy that this season is already more than half over. 
3,6,The Climb,My body is ready. My mind is willing.
3,6,The Climb,I'll be damned if Thoros isn't always drinking.
3,6,The Climb,HOLY SHIT O.O...that was a brutal and unexpected end to Ros' character
3,6,The Climb,Do I look like a fucking umber! Favorite line of the whole episode
3,6,The Climb,"Did anyone else find it hard to believe that when Theon was playing the game with ""boy"", he guessed that he was a karstark when [ADWD](#b ""he was raised in the north for 10 years and served as Ned's warden. I just don't know why he guessed Umber or Karstark instead of the house that is renowned for flaying and torture. Also, he was pretty much a reenactment of their sigil."")"
3,6,The Climb,Why is the blackfish giving edmure shit about not wanting to marry? Talk about calling the kettle black.
3,6,The Climb,"I am curious to see Arya's storyline. The Red Witch implies Arya goes on to kill people. So i guess Arya returns to the Starks, but cannot settle down, so she summons Jaquen with that coin, and travels with him to kill those people? That is probably a little farfetched. 

Also when the Red Witch mentioned ""blue eyes"" i was hoping Arya would comment on the Witches blue eyes. That wouldve been perfect.

If Tyrion marries Sansa, surely that would be a good thing for her? She would be...protected? From the horror that is Joffery. Tyrion is a nice guy, he wouldnt abuse her like most."
3,6,The Climb,"I noticed tonight as Jon and Ygritte gazed over The Wall at both sides. For all it's height, The Wall is only a few steps wide."
3,6,The Climb,Roose Bolton reminds me of Daniel Craig to the point of being distracting.
3,6,The Climb,"Best episode of the season for me. Practically all the scenes were awesome, and Littlefingers speech gave me the biggest gooseboner"
3,6,The Climb,"''Chaos isn't a pit, chaos is a ladder.'' Littlefinger's monologue at the end gave me chills."

3,6,The Climb,Joffrey quickly becoming the new Mad King
3,6,The Climb,"Jesus, Iwan Rheon is hauntingly good in his role, how the hell can he manage to make me laugh while he is cutting the skin off of a persons finger."

3,6,The Climb,"Lost a lot of respect for Thoros and Beric.  Go on preaching about how you hold no allegiances and how you just want to help people, but you turn around and sell someone out because some chick shows up and namedrops your god."

3,6,The Climb,"When Jaime said ""I'm afraid I must insist"", all I heard was ""I'm afraid I must incest""."

3,6,The Climb,The horn returns!
3,6,The Climb,Turns out Tywin Lannister isn't pro-marriage equality.
3,6,The Climb,"ASOS is my favourite book in the series, as it is for many fans, but I've never been so happy and satisfied with a tv/film adaptation of a book that deviated freely from the source material as I am with this season. 

The first season was very by-the-book, scene-for-scene, which made fans happy, but the people making the show seem to be more comfortable with making changes and making the show something really special."
3,6,The Climb,NO WHAT! I ran to get some water and I missed what happened to Ros! Why did she get killed?
3,6,The Climb,"The Queen of Thorns is becoming one of the greatest characters. That Tywin scene with her was amazing. 
"
3,6,The Climb,"Is the next episode the one titled ""The Bear and the Maiden""?

"
3,6,The Climb,Whew!!! For a minute there I thought they were going to try to humanize and make me like Joffrey this season. 
3,6,The Climb,Holy awesome murder! Even fan favorite characters that don't exist in the books aren't safe!
3,6,The Climb,"Loved it when Roose goes ""I would have thought you'd learn your lesson about overplaying your... position""
"
3,6,The Climb,"[ASOS/ADWD](#b ""The flayed man sigil creeping behind Jaime and Brienne in every moment of that scene... very awesome foreshadowing/subtle hinting."")"
3,6,The Climb,And of course my father would walk in at the exact moment there is a naked whore riddled with arrows pinned to a bed on the screen.
3,6,The Climb,I don't see this anywhere so I'm going to post it. I have a feeling Margery may have had something to do with the shooting of Ros. The multiple bolts and some missing and the foreshadowing with her and Joff a few episodes back that she wanted to learn to shoot the crossbow and do something to please him. She may also be collaborating with Littlefinger who no longer trusted or needed Ros. 
3,6,The Climb,"Thus we all shed a tear for dear Roz, who came with us through the first three seasons, only to fall to the hand of Joffrey. The beast of a king has doused another ray of hope.

Also, anytime I hear a reference to a sword swallower, I am now going t have to suppress my urge to make a joke about a certain flower growing strong.

I also felt myself being oddly enthralled by the Theon scene, like, temple-ing my fingers and saying ""yes"" enthralled, despite the fact that I actually kind of like Theon as a character.

Oddly enough, Brienne (Gwen) looked quite fetching in her dress . . . possibly because she was sitting and the gaudiness wasn't nearly as eyegrabbing as keeping track of Jaime's stump.

*EDIT* Also, Melisandre's vision, I had a smug nod at that, and hope it comes back to bite her in the ass one day."
3,6,The Climb,Is it me or is the red woman creepier than usual?
3,6,The Climb,i fucking hate joffrey
3,6,The Climb,Ygritte is fast becoming Jon's overly attached girlfriend

3,6,The Climb,Meera and Osha handling the meat in their own way...
3,6,The Climb,Today I can officially say skinned rabbits turn me on.
3,6,The Climb,"I feel like Loras' gayness is being overplayed a little. I'm straight, but if I HAD to act like I was romantically interested in a gay man I could. Every line out of Loras' mouth seems like the writers trying to remind us of his sexuality.

Maybe I'm just not as straight as he is gay? Is *anybody* that gay?"
3,6,The Climb,RIP Ros' boobs you brought joy to so many
3,6,The Climb,"So tonight is the night I can finally be shocked by a twist again.


*I am ready*

Edit: The twist was that they killed a whore?"
3,6,The Climb,"[Spoilers for all books](/b ""I feel that the Red Woman's comment to Arya about how they will meet again holds a lot of weight for book readers. We've got to reset our theories to accommodate for a Melisandre/Stannis meet-up with our young assassin."")"

3,6,The Climb,Awwwwww Ros! SERIOUSLY?
3,6,The Climb,Wow... that ending monologue with Petyr Baelish. This show is amazing.

3,7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,"Is anyone else thinking they're hinting a little more into the possibility of Talisa being a spy? The writing of the letter, and the fact that it's not in the common tongue is something quite notable. Also, a little something that seemed like a hint was that Robb was completely distracted by her; he was trying to plan, but her and her perfectly shaped butt were too much for him to pay attention to his duty. This is an ongoing theory, and I think they were at least teasing it. "

3,7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,"After this episode, one thing has become clear: Ygritte is the baddest bitch in Westeros. She doesn't have words for losing consciousness from fear.

3,7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,I really like the direction they are taking Gendry in the TV series. I think combining him with Edric Storm was a brilliantly prudent move on the double D's part and will turn him into a much more developed character.

3,8,Second Sons,Jorah burn.
3,8,Second Sons,The least of the Lannisters is the best of them.
3,8,Second Sons,"REALLY great casting job with Daario, in my opinion. They forgo the purple beard in the show, and he's younger than I always pictured, but damn if that guy isn't charismatic as fuck. The actor pulls off the easy cockiness and ""play by my own rules"" womanizing charm amazingly."

1) you have three slugs to kill anyone and you use on Balon Greyjoy?

2)  Melissandre didn't let the boy finish?

Jeez!"

And he makes a convincing case."
3,8,Second Sons,Fucking ~~Daario~~ Benjen.
3,8,Second Sons,"Damn Cersei, you crazy."
3,8,Second Sons,I seriously hope Joffrey dies after that. Although it was pretty hilarious.
3,8,Second Sons,Tyrion and Joffrey drunk together. What could go wrong?
3,8,Second Sons,Tyrion is spitting some serious game this episode.
3,8,Second Sons,Getting Hitchcockian up in here.
3,8,Second Sons,"""And now my watch begins..."" Loved that "
3,8,Second Sons,"Sansa has more willpower than me. The point where Joffrey said that 'Your father's gone' line would have been the moment when whatever was left of my sanity cracked and I would start to throttle the little fucker right there in the sept.

Also, props to Tywin keeping his pimp hand strong and shutting up the laughter with a look."
3,8,Second Sons,"Gendry: ""What are you doing?

Mel: "" I'm into some kinky shit."""

Man, what a line from Tyrion. Just absolutely awesome."
3,8,Second Sons,Why did you leave the only thing that appears to kill white walkers on the ground Samwell???
3,8,Second Sons,"Did anyone else notice Daario use the line ""lovely girl"" to Dany?  And the dude that was cast has very similar bone structure to the last face Jaqen had...tinfoil anyone?"
3,8,Second Sons,It amazes me someone as huge of a bitch as Sam has even survived this long
3,8,Second Sons,"Okay lets everyone just remember that Sophie Turner the actress playing Sansa is 17, and probably 16 at the time of her degowning"
3,8,Second Sons,"Ok, i can live with Daario not having blue hair...but not even a gold tooth? irksome. "
3,8,Second Sons,"This is the most awkward we've ever seen Tyrion. It's adorable.
"

3,8,Second Sons,"That was subtle, Cersei.."
3,8,Second Sons,Maybe Melisandre is just a really dedicated House Baratheon groupie
3,8,Second Sons,Three leeches?

3,8,Second Sons,God damn this was a great episode. Daario is a great character. He has an other worldiness to him that reminds me of Jaquen. The ending with Sam killing the White Walker was fantastic and probably one of the most fanstasy oriented things the show has done so far. It was just so cool.

Rickon, Bran, Arya, Sansa, Robb… Robb… please, Ned, please, make it stop, make it stop hurting… The white tears and the red ones ran together until her face was torn and tattered, the face that Ned had loved. Catelyn Stark raised her hands and watched the blood run down her long fingers, over her wrists, beneath the sleeves of her gown. Slow red worms crawled along her arms and under her clothes. It tickles. That made her laugh until she screamed. “Mad,” someone said, “she’s lost her wits,” and someone else said, “Make an end,” and a hand grabbed her scalp just as she’d done with Jinglebell, and she thought, No, don’t, don’t cut my hair, Ned loves my hair.

3,9,The Rains of Castamere,"That night, after the plates had been cleared, Robb carried Bran up to bed himself. Grey Wind led the way, and Summer came close behind. His brother was strong for his age, and Bran was as light as a bundle of rags, but the stairs were steep and dark, and Robb was breathing hard by the time they reached the top.

He put Bran into bed, covered him with blankets, and blew out the candle. For a time Robb sat beside him in the dark. Bran wanted to talk to him, but he did not know what to say. “We’ll find a horse for you, I promise,” Robb whispered at last.

“Are they ever coming back?” Bran asked him.

“Yes,” Robb said with such hope in his voice that Bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just Robb the Lord. “Mother will be home soon. Maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes. Wouldn’t that surprise her, to see you ahorse?” Even in the dark room, Bran could feel his brother’s smile. “And afterward, we’ll ride north to see the Wall. We won’t even tell Jon we’re coming, we’ll just be there one day, you and me. It will be an adventure.”

“An adventure,” Bran repeated wistfully. He heard his brother sob. The room was so dark he could not see the tears on Robb’s face, so he reached out and found his hand. Their fingers twined together.

3,9,The Rains of Castamere,"The Hound is fucking boss. Knows exactly what has happened, knows how Arya will react, and does what needed to be done.

Edit: Look at it this way. What was the best case scenario for the Hound before tonight's episode? To ransom Arya off for money. Does what happened at the Twins change that for him? Well not really, but he's not going to get his ransom from Cat or Robb now. But there are others that will pay for Arya's ransom. A house still loyal to the Starks, extended family, or heck, even the enemy would pay a hefty price for a Stark child. Pay the ransom, marry her to your son, off Sansa who is the last remaining *known* heir at the moment, and you've got the key to the North. But back to my point about the Hound, he can still ransom Arya to *someone*, but not if she goes running off and gets herself captured or killed. The best thing to do is knock her out so he doesn't make a scene carting away a kicking and screaming girl, and then once he regroups, he can decide where to take her."

Edit: It is kind of interesting that this was as much of a surprise to the book watchers as it was to the readers. For those of you that don't know and want to know about Robb's wife in the book, Jeyne Westerling: [ASOS-ADWD](#b ""Robb never brings Jeyne the Red Wedding, in fear of the slight it may cause Walder Frey. Instead, she stays behind at Riverrun with the Blackfish. Her mother was a traitor who helped the Lannisters though. Her mother tells the Lannisters she secretly gave Jeyne moon tea so she won't have Robb's heir. However, some readers think Jeyne is carrying Robb's heir because the accounts of her physical description differ. Catelyn describes Jeyne as having wide hips. When Jaime meets her after Robb's death, he describes her as having narrow hips. Some readers think this means Jaime didn't meet the real Jeyne, but her younger sister instead, and that Jeyne escaped with the Blackfish. However, GRRM has stated this was a mistake on his part. Still, some readers think Robb's heir is out there, but this scene killed that speculation."")"

Robb would have showed up at the Twins for his marriage. He would have been a bit nervous, but then cute little miss Frey would show up, and all would be well, and we would have a cute little westerosi queen in the north.. The festivities would have been surprisingly nice, the bedding ceremony would have been funny, a sword needs a sheath, etc etc etc. We could still have baby version of Ned Stark, but with absolutely no connection to sean bean......

In the following weeks, Robb would have sacked Casterly Rock, and won the war in the south. The chaos in the north would have eventually been brought under control.....

Just think. There would have been a happy ending if Robb could just have kept it in his pants.

The Boltons."
3,9,The Rains of Castamere,"For everyone in shock right now: that was **The Red Wedding.**

It was a betrayal perpetrated by the Boltons and Freys conspiring to join the Lannister side.  

RIP Robb, RIP Cait, RIP Talisa, RIP Greywind, RIP Men of the Northern Army. 

Yes, it actually happened. 

"
3,9,The Rains of Castamere,I don't have HBO. I can't watch the episode until tomorrow. I've read the books. My neighbors upstairs were watching it. Biggest fucking cocktease ever when I heard the Rains of Castamere coming from the floor above me.
3,9,The Rains of Castamere,"That complete silence at the end credits is eerie as hell

*Edit- On the plus side it made it easy to tell that my remote hitting the wall was, in fact, louder than my book hitting the ground during the red wedding."
3,9,The Rains of Castamere,Edmure's facial reactions in this scene are priceless.
3,9,The Rains of Castamere,"Wow, she's actually kinda hot for a Frey"

Oh god now I'm crying.
And now I'm in a fetal position.

I haven't even read the books, fucking tumblr spoiled it for me a little bit, but I just..

"
3,9,The Rains of Castamere,"Naming the kid Eddard was really over the top. And reminding Arya about Ned's death right before this happened. And then the stab-stab-abortion of Ned Jr. They somehow managed to make the Red Wedding even *worse* by bringing up the Ned stuff into it.

Great job, HBO. I'm happy with the way you guys pulled this off.

Heh."
3,9,The Rains of Castamere,"Not sure if this will be noticed under the onslaught of pain and schadenfreude, but I thought there was one nice little note during the wedding scenes.  When Bolton asks about Cat's bedding, she says that Ned refused it and even threatened violence on anyone trying to force the issue--very much like Tyrion in the last episode.  

Especially with Tyrion's borderline sad reaction to the news in the preview for the next episode (and the fact that he will likely be the one to have to break the news to Sansa), it was interesting and perhaps a bit hopeful to see the writers compare Tyrion's strength of character to Ned's. 

Edit: while I'm noting cool stuff that's not soul-shatteringly horrifying, I think I'll mention Sam and Gilly.  While the scene seems out of place on the face of things [ASOS Book Three and possible EP10 Spoilers](/b ""though they may be moving them into place to do the nightfort next week""), I thought it made an important thematic connection.  

There have been a lot of discussions in the show about what power is or can be--knowledge, reputation, force, ""a shadow on the wall"".  While Cersei and early Jaime are more of the 'power is power' stripe, Tywin's made it clear throughout the seasons that that's not how he thinks.  Tywin's shown there are other ways to wield power besides direct, obvious force, and we saw him all season simply penning letters while Cersei urged him to to something and he assured her he was doing ""all I can"".  This was more concretely emphasized when he gave Olenna an ultimatum, wielding his pen as another man might wield a sword, and she gives in and snaps the quill in defeat, signalling that he does not need to bring his power to bear.

Gilly's awe reminds us of the power of the written word, which is how Tywin set this whole thing up, and links us back to the question of what power really is, which the preview for next week shows will be quite relevant going forward."

3,9,The Rains of Castamere,"Holy. Fucking. Shit.

I had an idea something was coming from accidentally looking at a spoiler, but nothing to that level of brutal. Filch you fucking cunt.

 I'm guessing the significance of the starks as a military force in the rest of the series has just disappeared. Was praying Arya got Robb's wolf out of the cage. So sad."
3,9,The Rains of Castamere,Holy crap that was brutal! Dan and Dave and Co. actually took it farther here what with the fetus stab and Frey's wife and Arya having a chance to unleash the wolf but not going for it! Man oh man oh man
3,9,The Rains of Castamere,Bran just got promoted....
3,9,The Rains of Castamere,"at the start I noticed [the wolves had their backs turned against House Bolton and House Frey.](http://i.imgur.com/RX2gl46.jpg)

Pretty cool."
3,9,The Rains of Castamere,"I'm so upset right now. I literally feel like I'm dying. I want to discuss but my boyfriend has no soul and has already moved on to watching Role Models with his bros as if the world hasn't collapsed and the worst thing ever hasn't happened.

I'm nearly halfway through the 3rd book but have NOT gotten to that horrific, heart wrenching, scream inducing scene. Strangers everywhere- Starbucks, bus stops-have warned me about what is about to happen but with no hints. I THOUGHT I WAS PREPARED. 

For some reason this makes me hate Dany. I think I just need to be mad at someone because I normally love her but right now she sucks. She doesn't even do anything. She makes everyone do everything for her and isn't even cool right now ugh. 

ALSO OMFG ARYA!!! Can anything worse happen to her? Poor girl but jesus I hope she's gonna grow up to be so badass and kill everyone with her list-of-names prayers. Like a more ruthless and lack of morals Brienne.

I feel like I just saw someone get murdered in real life and for the next like 2 weeks I'm gonna think I'm happy and then BAM I'm gonna remember that scene and just lay down and hate everyone haha.

The only comparison for me in terms of absolute devastation is when Buffy stabbed Angel in the heart. God damn it. 

Honestly though WHAT  brave author our Mr. Martin is. I'm honestly super impressed. Like fuck him but also mad respect "

Growing up, my father, who is now 75, would secretly watch PBS. When we'd go into the tv room, he'd change it quickly to a sports game. But we got wise.

I used to work with him in the summers in high school. Once, he whistled the theme from Sailor Moon. I never figured that one out.

It's taken 3 seasons of viewing - with him in the next room, listening, or peeking around the corner watching, or I suspect now watching in his room with the volume of his tv off - but tonight he sat and watched the season finale all the way through with us and said, ""so a happy ending, I guess? I don't know.""

3,10,Mhysa,DON'T OPEN THAT BOX THERE'S A DICK IN IT THERE'S A DICK IN IT THERE'S A D- god fucking dammit.
3,10,Mhysa,And the crow gets feathered...
3,10,Mhysa,"*Gendry: ""Why are you doing this?""
*Davos: ""Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner"""
3,10,Mhysa,Well shit. Guess I'll read the books now. 
3,10,Mhysa,"The Hound/Arya team fucking owned shit up, that was so fucking badass."
3,10,Mhysa,"Gonna get absolutely buried but here are my thoughts:

- Neat theme throughout the episode of the debate that the lives the many outweigh the lives of the few. We got to see Tywin's version of utilitarianism that I'd call Lannisterism where the ethical choice is the one that creates the greatest good for as many Lannisters as possible. Stannis struggled with the same dilemma and chose the needs of the kingdom over the life of Gendry. Jon needs to ""go home"" because he believes he is sacrificing his own happiness with his lover for the needs of the watch - his new family. Dany manages to meet the needs of the many with no sacrifice which is, in my opinion, the weakest of the scenes we get that follow this theme. In an episode about sacrifice and weighing the worst of two options she sacrifices nothing and makes no difficult decisions yet still gets huge reward.

- I really enjoyed the minor theme about the only name that matters in Westeros is the House name. Theon gets his House name taken from him. Jamie realizes that a name is only as valuable as the image surrounding it. 

- Excellent transitions throughout most of the episode. Cutting from discussions about guest rights to Frey acting like an evil genius is fun. Only sloppy transition I found was the transition to Jon Snow heading back to the wall. I felt a little bit disoriented as to where Jon was and how Ygritte could possibly catch up to him like that with no horse or sneak up on him in a massive open field. It was so jarring and unreal feeling that I was almost sure it was going to be just something dreamt by Jon or Ygritte.

- Melisandra developments are interesting. There's a lot of room to theory craft what her goal is. The big question on my mind is what is it about the letter from the Night's Watch that made her basically do a complete 180 on the direction that she was pushing Stannis in? We thought her original goal was to get a king on the iron throne who believed in the Red God and through that propagate the religion and her own power. What could fighting the White Walkers possibly serve? Could she really be a good person? That seems unlikely and we're left puzzling her goals. Additionally it's a puzzle why she keeps Davos around - most people will expect her to try to use him in some devious way in the future. This episode made me a lot more interested in the Stannis narrative.

- Arya and the Hound is adorable. I lol's at the Hound's responses to the murders Arya just committed. I lol'd again when you can see Arya looking all shocked and you can see the Hound in the background just chowing down on the food the now dead twins soldiers were cooking. The viewer is left wondering if Arya will be able to keep the Hound on her revenge list? It was heavily foreshadowed in previous episodes that Arya would try to kill him at some point but he has certainly removed her from enough dangerous situations to at least warrant consideration for removal from the list.

- Yara seems to have some heroic qualities. Or at least she has the same ""family first"" mentality that the Lannisters have. I only hope that her fifty men are enough. I don't expect she'll be betrayed like Theon was due to the evidence we've seen of most Iron Born following her every command. I am surprised the Balon didn't give in when he knew Yara was leaving as she's basically the heir to the Iron Islands and if something were to happen to her while rescuing Theon the situation would be even worse for him. I guess Balon is a mighty stubborn man.

- With no Robb Stark to contend with will King's Landing respond to the call from the Night's Watch? We already know Stannis will be there. In recent events it seems like King's Landing has completely forgotten about Stannis though I highly doubt they'll be able to make amends and fight together.

- Could Dany's newly free slaves be a liability in the war to come? The show is building her up to be invincible in battle much like it did with Robb Stark yet she doesn't suffer the same weaknesses he did since her army has an almost religious devotion to her and has no stake in the Westeros political scene - the Lannister's strength. The only weaknesses in Dany's armor could potentially be Dario or Jorah with Dario being the biggest unknown of the two."
3,10,Mhysa,I completely forgot Theon had his dick chopped off. That's like the second most tragic thing that's happened this season.

3,10,Mhysa,"I don't have an issue with it, but essentially this was just a foundation construction episode for S4.

As I always tell non-readers, GOT is like a chess game in which the pieces are occasionally knocked off and the game must reset.  This was the first attempt at re-setting for the post-Robb story dynamics—refreshing us on the presence of the Greyjoys, establishing Stannis northward, making the Bolton connection, re-connecting Castle Black, etc."

3,10,Mhysa,"Oh, thank fuck. I was so afraid they were gonna go for broke and actually burn Gendry. After Talisa, no one is safe."
3,10,Mhysa,"Wait, Davos to the rescue. Teaching his surrogate son about boats and shit.

He's a good dad and a slow learner.

&lt;3"
3,10,Mhysa,and thus the invention of crowdsurfing!
3,10,Mhysa,I like how they added the scene with Ygritte and Jon. Very powerful 
3,10,Mhysa,"Heh, turns out Sam kept the dagger."
3,10,Mhysa,"""Where did you get the knife?""

""From you.""

Bloody brilliant."
3,10,Mhysa,[removed]
3,10,Mhysa,Ramsay really knows how to give the best gifts: http://i.imgur.com/IlWbBpQ.jpg
3,10,Mhysa,That ending was lame.
3,10,Mhysa,Reek it rhymes with PLEASE KILL ME.
3,10,Mhysa,"""Any man who says I am the King is no true King.""  Twyin is a cunt, but I love seeing him verbally bitchslap Joffrey. "
3,10,Mhysa,Remember that Tywin has experience dealing with Mad Kings.
3,10,Mhysa,"at the rate all of the good characters are being killed off, Osha and Davos are going to end up together and rule the seven kingdoms"
3,10,Mhysa,"Nice nickname, Theon. It rhymes with a lot of stuff, I hear."
3,10,Mhysa,Yara just argued with Balon for a good ten seconds without saying a word.
3,10,Mhysa,"It's okay to kill, just warn Sandor first! Love the Hound."
3,10,Mhysa,What the fuck Ygritte?
3,10,Mhysa,"HE PRONOUNCED ""KNIGHT"" AS NIGGIT god damn FUCK ME"
3,10,Mhysa,A golden dragon to the first person to deliver a .gif of Ramsay Snow shaking a sausage at Theon!
3,10,Mhysa,"What's the life of a bastard boy against a kingdom?

Everything. "
3,10,Mhysa,"""The King is tired. Show him to his chambers"". No one fucks with Tywin Lannister. As much as I hate him for his iron fist, he is just so bad ass. "
3,10,Mhysa,"""Why is there a g in night?""

I agree, Davos."
3,10,Mhysa,"Considering the seven million twists post-Red Wedding they could've added to the finale, it was sorta disappointing.

That being said, I adored some scenes.
-""King of the North!"" was horrifying.
-Arya being death metal was amazing. Her buddy comedy with Sandor will be even more fun than in the book.
-Yggrite and Jon. Heartbreaking.

Actually in general it was a cool episode, but they could've had at least ONE of the big Storm twists."
3,10,Mhysa,"As a non-book reader the premiere left me feeling disappointed, was expecting for the finale to blow me away but it was kind of just ""that's cool""."
3,10,Mhysa,Anyone else notice the two chicks eyeing Podricks junk as he came down the stairs to talk to Tyrion? Word gets around fast. 
3,10,Mhysa,"Oh shit, what's going to happen when Brienne finds out Catelyn's dead? Maybe she'll join the Hound-Arya murder team! Fuck yeah!"
3,10,Mhysa,"Guess they realized the 4th book is weak as hell, so they are setting up new storylines now. Asha Ironborn storyline is going in a completely different direction than books. "
3,10,Mhysa,Winter is coming but Theon Greyjoy will not be. 
3,10,Mhysa,"Mhysa, Mhysa!! Get me outta here!

...for all you Happy Gilmore fans"
3,10,Mhysa,"Calling it now, [ASOS](#b ""Lady Stoneheart"") is gonna be the cliffhanger.

3,10,Mhysa,Ramsay! The reveal is here!
3,10,Mhysa,"""You think I'm some sort of savage?"""
3,10,Mhysa,I felt like this was a girl power episode in a way.
3,10,Mhysa,Theon's dick's in a box. (It's in a box)
3,10,Mhysa,There is so much crap they have to show next season that they held off or saved. Season 4 will be the greatest season we've had.
3,10,Mhysa,Pip? Sam.....? sounds like another story i once read!
3,10,Mhysa,"I'll be really mad if they [ACOK](#b ""change Shae's character that much."")

Just sayin'."
3,10,Mhysa,"Loved the conversation between Walder Frey and Roose Bolton. Incredible acting, and great scene overall."
3,10,Mhysa,Glad Tywin finally said what we're all thinking about who's really king.
3,10,Mhysa,Man... Dragonstone has some bitchin' sunsets.
3,10,Mhysa,Watching that Jon and Ygritte scene: http://i.imgur.com/U2v0g.gif
3,10,Mhysa,"I recommend that every fan of Game of Thrones read the books  in the months we have before the next season. I don't care if you're not an avid reader or if you're busy all the time--fucking Davos was illiterate and he found time to LEARN to read, so what's your excuse? "
3,10,Mhysa,"This is the first season where I've actually watched it along with everyone else, just wanted to say it's been a hell of a journey and I look forward to seeing you guys here next season, apart from The Boltons and the Freys, they can fuck right off"
3,10,Mhysa,"Keep reading, Davos!

[ASOS post season 3](#b ""AND YOU GET A TRIP TO THE WALL, STANNIS! AND YOU TOO, MELISANDRE!"")
"
3,10,Mhysa,Not a fan of that ending. 
3,10,Mhysa,"Favorite Tyrion quote: ""its not easy being drunk all the time, otherwise everyone would do it."" Wise words from a wise man."
3,10,Mhysa,Davos learned how to read in mere months. I've been taking a French class for a year and I can barely tell you the date today.
3,10,Mhysa,"[ASOS](#b ""WHERE IS MY STONEHEART?!"")"
3,10,Mhysa,If Daenerys were a president she'd be Baberaham Lincoln.
3,10,Mhysa,"For people upset about the ending, recall that it's not the end of the book. There's no big cliffhanger reveal halfway through a book. And [ASOS](#b ""Lady Stoneheart"") is not revealed till the end of the book.

Still could've been better though..."
3,10,Mhysa,Jesus am I the only one who kind of loved the ending? It's nice to see one of these rulers actually embracing her people up close and personal.
3,10,Mhysa,[removed]
3,10,Mhysa,And now my (41 week) watch begins.
3,10,Mhysa,"So, I'm using HBOgo for the first time today. When do the episodes usually go up? Do they wait until after the episode has finished airing on TV?"
3,10,Mhysa,"I can't stop imagining Jar Jar Binks saying ""Mhysa"" as ""Mista mista"""
3,10,Mhysa,Oh..... Shit...... 
3,10,Mhysa,"Tywin is such a badass. Seriously, he is like the Don Corleone of Westeros."
3,10,Mhysa,Tywin wins again. And again. 
3,10,Mhysa,Sam/Bran! It's happening! IT'S HAPPENING!
3,10,Mhysa,"The fact that Ramsey was eating a sausage in front of Theon after he was cut. Jesus. What the hell, man.
"
3,10,Mhysa,"[ASOS] ( #b ""Well, no Lady Stoneheart. I was disappointed that they ended on Dany again. That was underwhelming. I guess we know how next season ends though."")"
3,10,Mhysa,"Just wondering, do we know who ended up telling Sansa the news?"
3,10,Mhysa,STANNIS LAUGHED.
3,10,Mhysa,Hodor is famous for his Hodoring. 
3,10,Mhysa,Who else is not eating sausages for the rest of fuck?
3,10,Mhysa,"When Arya saw RobbWind...
feels."
3,10,Mhysa,"God, I feel so bad for Theon."
3,10,Mhysa,"Wait, it's the next episode already? But I'm not even finished crying from last week's!"
3,10,Mhysa,Inciting the Lion is far worse than waking the Dragon
3,10,Mhysa,The crowd surfing was too much.
3,10,Mhysa,"**ALL OF YOU FINALLY KNOW HIS NAME, HUZZAH!!!**"
3,10,Mhysa,"[Balon Greyjoy, right now.](http://i.imgur.com/g9m48.gif)"
3,10,Mhysa,He sent them Theon's dick didnt he...
3,10,Mhysa,"What is your name? 
-Theon Greyjoy.
(Smack)
What is your name?
Kunta Kinte!
....Wait, what?"
3,10,Mhysa,"I think everyone complaining needs to realize that a majority of the audience haven't read the books. Only a minority have. So is it really that infuriating to you that they'd use tonight to wrap up a lot of the storylines and give a sort of ""cooldown"" episode for them? Why create more plotlines with the amount of them we already had? I find it better that they wrapped up so many in this one Finale so now we can look forward to all the other plotlines coming without the previous ones requiring airtime too. And if you're saying ""but what about cliffhangers!"" We still got cliffhangers, just not at the end of the episode.

If anything, I would be more disappointed in the absence of any mentions of [Future Spoilers](#b ""The Martells."") Seeing as how those storylines begin to be woven into the book timeline right around this time yet nowhere to be spotted yet in the show."
3,10,Mhysa,And now it's time to cancel HBO until next season.
3,10,Mhysa,"Wow, nothing really happened this season. Oh yeah, except that one wedding. You know, the one that devastated every fan on an emotional level?"
3,10,Mhysa,Fuck the Red Wedding. The real tragedy is that this is the last goddamn episode.
3,10,Mhysa,I hope today is the day Theon learns his name. 
3,10,Mhysa,The Roose is still loose.
4,1,Two Swords,Arya and the Hound walk into a bar. Everybody gets killed and they leave.
4,1,Two Swords,"Me: What's wrong with you, Cersei? Why won't you have sex with your brother?.......wait, what?"
4,1,Two Swords,"Maester Aemon (book/show) is simply the man. One of the very few honest, great men in Westeros."

4,1,Two Swords,The Queen of Thorns' reaction to seeing Brienne for the first time is priceless
4,1,Two Swords,"The Sandor-Arya banter is killing me.

4,1,Two Swords,Kit Harington is killing this scene. His acting has improved. 
4,1,Two Swords,Daenerys oughta try the Cesar Milan *tsst* on that dragon when he misbehaves like that
4,1,Two Swords,I can tell Maester Aemon got mad pussy in his younger years.
4,1,Two Swords,"""A one handed man with no family needs all the help he can get""

WOW TYWIN YOU A REAL FUCKIN DICK"
4,1,Two Swords,Jaime waving goodbye my sides
4,1,Two Swords,"It's amazing how much one can like Jaime at this point. We've come a long way from sister-fucking child-killer.

Edit: perhaps he'd still sister fuck, given the chance, as has been pointed out to me. Some have noted that book Jaime and show Jaime deal with that temptation differently. And, he didn't kill Bran, but that was certainly the goal. It is known."
4,1,Two Swords,I refuse to believe theres a sadness that lemon cakes cant solve.
4,1,Two Swords,"Yay Olenna! I still think it's funny that somebody who's considered an ugly hag in the books, is being portrayed by a *Bond Girl*. I don't think anybody else could do the role justice like Rigg has, I just find amusement in the irony of that casting."
4,1,Two Swords,"Titties and gay sex in episode one. Pace yourself HBO. 

EDIT: I posted this before they were interrupted. I understand there was no sex. Calm down. "
4,1,Two Swords,Oh my god Oberyn is perfect in every way

The Hound and Arya's last scene was fucking epic and brutal. Glad she's finally getting revenge on people.

Also how much of a smug asshole is Joffery? It must feel shit for Jaime when his own king and son tells him he hasn't accomplished anything yet he saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

Edit: added words 



"
4,1,Two Swords,"""Fuck the King.""

Better words were never spoken."
4,1,Two Swords,This will be the first season I watch the shows real-time. I am not sure if I can stand a week-long wait between each episode! 
4,1,Two Swords,Arya is getting her body count up
4,1,Two Swords,Four pages for Ser Duncan the Tall!  Damn right.
4,1,Two Swords,That was one of the best Game of Thrones fight scenes.  Incredibly gruesome and the cinematography was outstanding.

4,1,Two Swords,This is the only thing that makes waiting for The Winds of Winter a little easier. Here's to watching and discussing another season with you lovely people.
4,1,Two Swords,So they are reintroducing Ser Dontos into the plot?

4,1,Two Swords,WHy isn't there a post-episode discussion thread? 90% of this thread is people talking about the episode before it aired and reacting to lines as they happen (which is expected and fine). Now that everyone has seen it there should be a thread where we can discuss what happened in detail.

4,1,Two Swords,Drogon is hitting his teenage rebellion stage. Step one: Sass Mouth
4,1,Two Swords,"I'm disappointed there's almost no talk about Tyrion here. He was very emasculated this episode, more than we almost ever see for a man who's usually so cunning and dominant in his conversations. It was interesting to watch."

4,1,Two Swords,"Oh Benjen, you're such a romantic. "
4,1,Two Swords,12 minutes before nudity. They're slipping.
4,1,Two Swords,"Thats right. The Hound isn't going to just eat ONE of your chickens. He's gonna eat fucking ALL OF THEM. The chemistry between Arya and the Hound was fucking incredible. Those death glares, fighting like badasses. They are already stealing the season and they've only had 5 or 6 minutes of screen time. GOOD GOD IVE MISSED THIS SHOW. "

4,1,Two Swords,I loved everything about the premiere but the Daario recast is really bugging me. I hate recasts in general because it pulls you out of the immersion but I also liked the original actor better than this guy.

4,1,Two Swords,"That was some legit, Tarantino, *Inglourious Basterds* tension for a few minutes during that final scene. "
4,1,Two Swords,"I think the final scene with the Hound and Arya might be my favorite of the entire series.  Insanely brutal and the tension while Sandor drank the ale was hardly bearable, perfectly done."

4,1,Two Swords,What did tywin lanister burn after forging the two swords at the start??
4,1,Two Swords,Fucking Chickens...
4,1,Two Swords,"everyone's talking about the awesome fight at the end, but how's about some love for the cold open? I was hoping for one and shouted with joy when it started. it's absolutely chilling, which is ironic because of the fiery imagery. the sad stark theme segueing into the menacing lannister theme... anger and goosebumps.

showing them dismantle the sword is symbolic of the dismemberment of the actual heads of the stark family, ned and then robb.

and then the reveal of tywin, goddamit it's all so simple and I love it. I mean I hate it, but I love it."

4,1,Two Swords,I think they did a great job portraying Oberyn in only his 5 minutes. The Bi stuff was pretty straight forward as its only heavily implied/rumored in the books. But for such a short time they accomplished alot. The guy playing him did a great job of balancing tough guy/sexy/serious/playful as he talked about in an interview before.
4,1,Two Swords,Clegane got his chickens. Arya got her pony and Needle. And they say Game of Thrones doesn't have happy endings :D
4,1,Two Swords,"That whole scene between Sansa and Dontos Hollard was great, and it's especially resonant when you consider that, as far as Sansa knows, she might be the last living Stark, just as Dontos is the last of his House."
4,1,Two Swords,"[ASOS](#b ""Its been some time since I read the books, but I remember that as soon Jaime got back, he and Cersei were fucking (in the sept of balor, is that right?) and he was actually the one realizing that something changed between them after that. In the TV Show she is just cock-blocking him. Seems a little off to me."")"
4,1,Two Swords,"""What the fuck's a Lommy""

god i love this show"
4,1,Two Swords,So Spanish accent dude just kinda announces to Tyrion that he's here to kill Lannisters?
4,1,Two Swords,Dat chin touch
4,1,Two Swords,"Jaime: still sexy as fuck, I see.





I'm a straight man."
4,1,Two Swords,"""Lots of people name their sword.""
""Lots of cunts.'
Ah I missed this guy"
4,1,Two Swords,Arya is metal as fuck. I missed her badassery.
4,1,Two Swords,Arya and the Hound is like my favorite relationship so far... Between the two of them the angst level is through the roof
4,1,Two Swords,Arya and The Hound dispensing street justice was one of my favorite scenes in the series to date. 
4,1,Two Swords,I think Oberyn my favorite character is even better in the show. Liked the little Lyanna mention there hopefully the show fully explains what happened. Arya is starting to get pretty creepy. 
4,1,Two Swords,Im just happy to see the Hound got his chickens
4,1,Two Swords,"Loved the end scene, Arya and Sandor riding off into the burning, wartorn riverlands to eat chickens and kill cunts."
4,1,Two Swords,"Is no one else going to mention the beautiful transition between the Wall and Meereen? 

Map porn at its finest."
4,1,Two Swords,"This episode both kicked Stark fans in the balls and gave us a little bit of hope. Absolutely loved how they incorporated Dontos' necklace.

Surprisingly, the people I watched the episode with don't like the new Daario. I think he it's too early to judge him."
4,1,Two Swords,That moment of understanding before Arya killed him was so incredibly satisfying. 
4,1,Two Swords,"""Someone forgot to write down all of your great deeds"" is my new favorite insult."
4,1,Two Swords,"The Hound is quickly becoming my favourite character alongside Tyrion and Jon now that Robb has.. Well, you know...

Hold me :'("
4,1,Two Swords,Well... I'm sold on this Oberyn.
4,1,Two Swords,Oberyn proving he knows how to handle a spear from the get go 
4,1,Two Swords,"Oh, shit. The Magnar and the Thenns look badass."
4,1,Two Swords,Loving how this scene is playing out almost exactly like the books. Shows the great care the writers take.
4,1,Two Swords,That was an amazing intro for Prince Oberyn!! 
4,1,Two Swords,[removed]
4,1,Two Swords,Is there gold hidden in the village? 
4,1,Two Swords,I sorta hope Arya goes full Heisenburg and constantly pushes the moral boundaries further and further
4,1,Two Swords,Old Daario had a much more seductive/threatening feel. I'm kind of sad they brought in a new one. 
4,1,Two Swords,Arya/Hound > Jaime/Brienne
4,1,Two Swords,"The beginning of the show damn near drove me to tears. The part where Tywin melts down Ice and turns into two separate swords, then burns Grey Wind's fur ;_;

But I felt better at the end with the Hound and Arya killing a bunch of Lannister bastards :D

I don't get why that whole are looked like it had been burned down though. I get the feeling it's explained in the book but I haven't gotten that far into them."
4,1,Two Swords,Loved the Jon Snow scene. I really feel like Ned would have been very proud there.
4,1,Two Swords,"I don't recall the Thenns being cannibals from the books ... Rather a shame because they're supposed to be more like the people South of the wall, with lords of their own and shit."
4,1,Two Swords,The scene where they reforge Ice broke my heart.
4,1,Two Swords,Christ I hate Janos Slynt.

4,1,Two Swords,[deleted]
4,1,Two Swords,"""Yes, yes one guard at the thing go on."" Best ruler i've ever seen on this show."
4,1,Two Swords,I'm sensing the theme of this episode is everyone in King's Landing shit on Jamie for being captured.
4,1,Two Swords,"That episode was one of the best looking episodes I've seen from this show. There was a sleekness or movie-like quality to it, I dunno how else to describe it. The directing was just amazing.  That fight scene was fuckin amazing and so was the intro.  God this season is going to kick so much ass. "
4,1,Two Swords,"A lot of people complain about Shae's acting, I am not one of them. However, even I can tell there was a big improvement from S3 to S4. Does anyone else agree?

Also, did anyone else notice the sneaky handmaiden is the same one from previous seasons? In particular, I recall her being the one to catch Sansa and Shae flipping the mattress over and running to tell Cersei before Shae stopped her. I really appreciate continuity such as bringing actors who had such bit parts back to the show!"
4,1,Two Swords,Needle and Arya! Best reunion ever!
4,1,Two Swords,"""Fine little blade. Maybe I’ll pick my teeth with it.” Got the chills."
4,1,Two Swords,How about that scene with Ser Dontos and Sansa? That'll be a great storyline this season.

4,1,Two Swords,Is no one going to mention Olenna fangirling over Brienne?
4,1,Two Swords,Looked through most of this thread and didnt see anyone question what symptoms Cersi had that Qyburn got rid of.. Thoughts?

4,1,Two Swords,"Cersei being a colossal bitch to Jaime.

""You have one hand.""

"
4,1,Two Swords,The only thing more boring than Daenerys Targaryen's story is pre-season baseball
4,1,Two Swords,And that's why Arya is probably my favorite character. 
4,1,Two Swords,"Some neat symbolism in this episode:

It's called ""Two Swords"", refering, obviously, to the two swords that are forged in the beginning. But it also starts with a sword symbolizing the Starks and ends with another, that, for Arya at least, *also* symbolizes that family. Additionally, while Ice is, as Tywin mentions ""absurdly large"", Needle is small. (Notice also how a small and a big sword is forged from Ice.) And there is that scene introducing Oberyn who lectures about how small swords are more practical in close quarters than broadswords. Which is mirrored in the last fight in the tavern, where both Sandor and the others soldiers stumble around with their big swords as much as they fight (which I'm sure is intentional), while Arya is able to use Needle to kill very effectively.

4,1,Two Swords,Who's fur/cloth was that thrown into the fire at the beginning of the show?

4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"SHIT! That scene was even crazier than I've expected it to be.

Edit: Damn, Lena Headley can act."

4,2,The Lion and the Rose,[removed]
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"Man, this episode was full of so many memorable moments. While I already knew all the actors were strong, the scenes tonight were some of the strongest, if not the strongest. 

-Tyrion's face as Joff poured the wine over his head.

-Sansa's stare into space as she watched the dwarves act out Robb's death.

-Cersei being even more bitchy than usual.

-Oberyn dropping bombs on Cersei and Tywin.

-Hodor.

4,2,The Lion and the Rose,i feel cheated that this episode ended at 9:55pm.   i could have done with 5 more minutes of slow painful death.
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"As someone who hasn't read the books, I fully expected this tonight.  Mainly, because of people who are trying not to spoil anything, while still spoiling something.  Everyone is always like, ""OMG THIS EPISODE IS GONNA BE SO GREAT"" ""GET HYPED""  so I expect a major death.  "

4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"Aww, gay little people jokes? Joff has stooped to a new low."
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,Have to say the make up on Joffrey's face was amazing! Great scene and great death. Jack Gleeson has acted soo well to make his character soo hateable
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"Holy crap. Biggest nod to the book readers / people who knew how he was going to die. 

 I was like, ""OMG here it is, he chokes now.....no wait....now...NOOO.....OK its happening now....noOooo...When is he going to choke?"" "
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,NICE DAY FOR A PURPLE WEDDING
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"I will hurt you for this. I don't know how yet, but give me time. A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you'll know the debt is paid."

4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"Loved the transition from the first Theon Greyjoy scene into Tyrion getting what looked like a massive sausage placed on his plate.

Bravo! "
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"After calming down my nerves, I firmly believe it was the Martells responsible for the Purple Wedding. Even more than Sansa, the Martells have the most reason to want revenge on the Lannisters/Joffrey. Couple that with Oberyn's (not even veiled) threat, it points to them."

There are many heroes in this series... but no character comes close to being as truly great a 'bad guy' as Joffery!

While he was an abhorrent, repugnant piece of shit... he was a fantastic character, one of the greatest villains in history. 

We are only up to season 4 and the most pivotal, most talked about and most emotion causing characters has gone!

I honestly thought he was going to last til the end... the show just wont be the same.

4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"This episode is where I make my one and only ""read the books"" plea to show watchers. Not because the books are better (because they're not, they're somehow just as good as the show in their own way), but because you get to experience Joffrey dying twice, in two different mediums, and can reread and savor that scene as many times and as slowly as you want.

On top of that, there are plenty more great moments you will want to experience over and over again from as many angles as possible. Read about Tyrion's wit, read about Daenerys turning into a badass, read about Arya impressing the fucking Hound with how brutal she is, read about all of that and everything else you have loved from the series already. Just read the books, because you love the show.

I started reading 3 episodes into season 3 of the show. The show didn't ruin the first books for me, and the books haven't ruined anything since then. This is really one of the very special instances where the book and film versions of something are equally amazing in their own right.

So for every show-watcher who hasn't read the books, read them! Not because they are better, but for the sole reason that you get twice as much GoT in your life, and it is amazing.

TL;DR : read the books so you can double the amount of Joffrey dying in your life.

edit: added a paragraph"
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,Is it weird I totally got off on his death. That was very satisfying. 
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,Tyrion is not amused one bit.
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,ULTRA TOLD
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"Joffrey, you alright, you cunt?"
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"Oh COME ON! It's not like Tyrion *planned* on being humiliated by Joeffrey in that exact way. Unless he carries poison on him at all times, it's not even plausible that Tyrion did it."
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"Good fucking riddance. Good lord that was satisfying. And Rains of Castamere on the credits? Suck it bitch. 

Feels like justice! "

Now he cannot breathe at all,

4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"I was completely not expecting Joff to die!!!!!!! wtf!!!! I mean great, but I wanted it to be a little more poetic!! Who's the next successor to the throne? 

Edit: Just re-watched the episode and I am predicting the killer is grandmother tyrell (sorry blanking on her name). She says ""killing a man at a wedding? what sort of monster would do that?"" She also comes over to Sansa to say this which puts her in the vicinity of the king's wine."

When he introduces Ellaria to Cersei and Tywin, is that a deliberate insult (because she is a Bastard) or does his attitude change because of Cersei's response?"
4,2,The Lion and the Rose,"As a dwarf, that was one of the most satisfying episodes to watch so far. Applauding Gleeson for nailing the role since day one. "

Be a little nicer about it Tywin. Geez."
4,3,Breaker of Chains,It's happening!
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Brother raping sister next to dead son......
4,3,Breaker of Chains,[deleted]
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"""Lesson one, Tommen, for the love of everything holy stay away from Myrcella!"""
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Pod :(
4,3,Breaker of Chains,\#podfeels
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Well no one boils a potato better 'an your mum!
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"""I don't give you a command.

I give you a choice."""
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin WTF do you know where his hand has been?
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Almost teared up at Tyrion's exchange with Podrick. The epitome of bittersweet. Pod is definitely my new favorite minor character.
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Tywin brokering a deal with Oberyn... What a masterclass in wartime tactics
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"Tywin is just such a bad ass.  Always playing every angle.  Easily, in my opinion, one of the best acted characters on the show."
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"""...which makes it unique as far as King's Landing murders go."""
4,3,Breaker of Chains,And the abolitionist of all time award goes to...Daenerys Targaryen!
4,3,Breaker of Chains,The talk between pod and Tyrion almost made me cry. Bro love for days.
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"Davos is quickly becoming my favorite character. I loved the Eureka moment, loved that he told the young lady ""I need a smart parson to do this (to write this)."" I know the attention is mostly focused on King's landing and the aftermath of the purple wedding, a big ""whodunit"" now, but I've been paying close attention and I think I've figured it out. For us non-bookreaders, I think it's important to pay attention to what else is going on in different parts of the narrative. Those events will probably be significant later."
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"Aaand...............Daario just got hot. I was disappointed with the recast, but the new guy brought something to this episdode. Maybe it was the wink
"
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"Tywin was ridiculously good in this episode. Talking shit about Joffrey right in front of his corpse and Cersei. I can kinda see now why he's pretty much the most powerful man in Westeros.

Edit: Oh yeah and you can't beat a good bit of incestuous sex beside your child's dead body."
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Can there be a spinoff show that is just the adventures of Arya and The Hound?  I would watch the shit out of that.
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"My favorite throw away line, ""Raper, raper, horse thief, ninth-born son, raper, thief, thief and raper..."""
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"Wisdom is know that a tomato is a fruit, but that you don't put in a fruit salad."
4,3,Breaker of Chains,http://reddit-stream.com/comments/23jx2l/ is a pretty good way to follow these live discussions.
4,3,Breaker of Chains,right next to your son's corpse?? That's not even right..
4,3,Breaker of Chains,So glad Sansa and Littlefinger are finally together. This is easily one of my favorite story arcs in the whole series! 
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"aww wtf, jaime... dis some fucked up shit"
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Long live Tommen!
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Yay more Arya and her pony!
4,3,Breaker of Chains,i'm so desensitized to people getting murdered now. it's kinda ridiculous.
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Eye rock Joffrey will forever haunt me.
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"Tommen is so innocent, I love him."
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"I'm getting the naivety from Tommen's voice, and I like it."
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"Holy crap, I'm loving this scene. Tywin dropping knowledge bombs."
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Is he about to get the birds and the bees?
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"Lean Headys silent acting during Tywins lecture was spectacular.  No words, amazing!"
4,3,Breaker of Chains,The Lanisters always make me realize how great my family is.
4,3,Breaker of Chains,"""Holiness...justice...strength.""

I like how Tommen thinks. Seems like a viable candidate...to die, perhaps?"
4,3,Breaker of Chains,Oh god that slurping is terrible
4,3,Breaker of Chains,A lot of rapers in the Seven Kingdoms.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Since we last saw Baelish, he arranged a marriage with Sansa's aunt, Lady of the Vale, assassinated the King of Westeros, and smuggled his true love's daughter out of the dangerous capital. He is officially the most dangerous man in the entire world."
4,4,Oathkeeper,You can practically see the moment Tommen entered puberty.
4,4,Oathkeeper,[deleted]
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Ahhh, so letting Craster keep sacrificing his male children WAS a failure of duty on the part of he Night's Watch. "
4,4,Oathkeeper,Aww Podrick's smile was the most adorable thing I've ever seen
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Holy crap, white walker babysitting services confirmed."
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Welp, looks like they finally did it.
They made it so even bookreaders were going ""What the fuck""?"
4,4,Oathkeeper,This is officially more information about the White Walkers than we've ever gotten. GRRM you sly dog. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,No Jon don't trust him. The music is ominous! 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"""May I come and visit you again?""

""Are you shitting me?"""
4,4,Oathkeeper,Grey worm and Davos should be study buddies.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Seriously, whoever created the Valyrian language has done such an a amazing job. "
4,4,Oathkeeper,I thought it was cute that both Tyrion and Sansa were unknowingly sticking up for one another.
4,4,Oathkeeper,It's like Brienne just got a nike sponsorship 
4,4,Oathkeeper,[deleted]
4,4,Oathkeeper,Margaery i don't think you understood grandma. You're supposed to fuck his brains out.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Show me on the cat where Margaery touched you
4,4,Oathkeeper,"All these ""Mhysa""s are starting to sound like Jar Jar Binks."
4,4,Oathkeeper,"This kid seems to be doing pretty well for having just witnessed the murder of his parents. Nice work, Ser Orphan. "
4,4,Oathkeeper,"What if the Others are actually really solid dudes who just want to protect the newborns of Westeros from a life filled of certain cruelty, one filled with rape, robbery, murder, and the sort? "
4,4,Oathkeeper,Cersei is climbing up the crazy ladder so fast that Lysa Arryn is gonna start getting jealous. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Ah, rape and drinking from the skull of Mormont. And this was looking like a relatively mild GoT episode until now..."
4,4,Oathkeeper,Poor Sansa. She's the girl that moved like 20 times growing up 
4,4,Oathkeeper,**Jaime:** I hope I got your measurements right! It’s not like I’ve memorized your every curve or anything this is all totally platonic.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"YES YOU DO, BRIENNE. YOU NEED *THIS* SQUIRE."
4,4,Oathkeeper,"It was nice of those slaves to write ""Kill the masters"" in the common tongue for us. "
4,4,Oathkeeper,Lol @ the sinister music playing when Locke stood up.
4,4,Oathkeeper,They definitely did ok with recasting Tommen. He looks as innocent and wide eyed as I imagined he would be while reading the books. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,[deleted]
4,4,Oathkeeper,And so begins the adventures of Brienne and Pod.
4,4,Oathkeeper,So the white walkers are creating an army filled with wildling incest babies. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Third time's the charm, Margy. You'll get your king one of these times."
4,4,Oathkeeper,"""He hated the little twat, but who didn't?"" - Bronn

Bronn, laying down the law. "
4,4,Oathkeeper,Does Dany have any other clothes besides that blue dress? 
4,4,Oathkeeper,It's crazy how Littlefinger's accent has changed the farther he's gotten from KL. Like he's dropping an act. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,OMG HODOR ABUSE. WHAT THE FUCK. I WANNA BASH THOSE GUYS SKULLS IN
4,4,Oathkeeper,Fuck off Janos. Nobody likes you. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,Natalie Dormer... every 13 year old boy's dream..
4,4,Oathkeeper,BRONN JUST BITCH SLAPPED HIM WITH HIS OWN FUCKING HAND
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Sansa: And what do you want?

Littlefinger: Dat ass"
4,4,Oathkeeper,White walker to baby: *boop*
4,4,Oathkeeper,[deleted]
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Jaime: You get new armor and my sword.

Podrick: ..and my AXE!"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Prediction for next episode:

Bran: ""We have to keep going north.""

Jon: ""K...Later."""
4,4,Oathkeeper,The mutineers are now #1 on the list of guys I want dead. You do NOT fuck with Hodor.
4,4,Oathkeeper,That baby knows how it feels to chew 5 gum.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"""If they catch you""

Sansa, dear, do you not know who the fuck you are talking to?"
4,4,Oathkeeper,Tommen's about to get laid or killed.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"That fucking kid at the Wall is going to die tragically, I know it. "
4,4,Oathkeeper,SER POUNCE MAKES HIS DEBUT. PRAISE THE LORD.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Why does Cersei always look like she just smelled a pile of shit? 

"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Two bodyguards are like ""fuck this shit, I'm out""."
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Watching the opening scene:

""Man I wonder if grey worm is going to end up tapping that?""

oooooh yeaaaaa :/"
4,4,Oathkeeper,'I Just Can't Wait To Be King' is totally playing in Tommen's head right meow.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Tommen was happier to see Sir Pounce then his smoking hot bride-to-be in the middle of the night.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"For a second there, I thought we were going to see Benjen Stark."
4,4,Oathkeeper,[removed]
4,4,Oathkeeper,NO. PLEASE NOT HODOR. JUST KILL BRAN OR SOMETHING.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"""Sorry folks, we didn't have the budget for the full slave uprising battle scene. But trust us, it was badass and totally worth it."""
4,4,Oathkeeper,That glorious Targaryen banner... oh yes.
4,4,Oathkeeper,*May The Lord of Light cast mercy down upon me as I embark on this episode with my grandparents by my side.*

4,4,Oathkeeper,"""What's the best way to intimidate the masters?""  
""We should write them a death threat in English."""
4,4,Oathkeeper,Greyworm is going Braveheart on these slaves with this speech.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Ser Pounce appearance. The Pounce That Was Promised theory confirmed. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"I USED TO KNOW THINGS WHEN I WATCHED THIS SHOW. 

SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT!?"
4,4,Oathkeeper,Tonight we've learned everything is Craster's fault.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Granny Tyrell could ride that dick back in her day is basically what she was telling Margaery before spilling the beans about her hand in the Joffrey poisoning
4,4,Oathkeeper,These Jaime/Bronn scenes are special. Sad about no Ser Ilyn but they did a damn good job replacing him. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Jaime + Brienne = Noble as fuck
Jaime + Cersei = The worst kind of human"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"As a book reader... What the fuck just happened? That scene was more exposition on them than we've ever gotten. 

Is that how The Others reproduce?
Do they have some sort of hierarchical system? What was with the devil horns? What was that weird ice castle about? Is this something the show added or are we already getting shit from TWOW? 

SO MANY QUESTIONS"
4,4,Oathkeeper,That is not how skulls work... ಠ_ಠ
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Well, whaddya know? Only one master in that whole damn city."
4,4,Oathkeeper,[removed]
4,4,Oathkeeper,ICE ICE BABY!
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Oh god fucking damn it, Bran. "
4,4,Oathkeeper,I personally would very much like to learn more about the Whitewalker Daycare Center...
4,4,Oathkeeper,I hope we find out what happened to benjen stark in this episode!
4,4,Oathkeeper,"God, it would fucking suck to be a female in Westeros. Your life would be rape and death."
4,4,Oathkeeper,POD IS THE GREATEST GIFT YOU COULD GET
4,4,Oathkeeper,I have no memory of this place.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Them being horrible to Hodor just breaks my heart
4,4,Oathkeeper,That's definitely not what I thought getting nailed by Khaleesi would be like. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Janos Slynt's beard is killing it.  Seriously, I bet it goes down to his pubes without getting less dense.  "
4,4,Oathkeeper,Wooooaahhhhhh...what did we just see? Not in the books...
4,4,Oathkeeper,[deleted]
4,4,Oathkeeper,"I can just imagine Jaime's thoughts, ""How the fuck did I fall in love with this cunt?"""
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Margaery, ""Omg, grandma. First you tell me you got pop pop because you slept with him before he proposed to your sister, and now you're telling me you killed my husband?! DAFUQ."""
4,4,Oathkeeper,DARTH MAUL BECAME A WHITE WALKER.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"So basically Craster is the reason the White Walkers are coming back.  All those fucking babies.  On a side note, how does a white walker baby grow and learn?  Do they have white walker day care? How cute are they? I need to know."
4,4,Oathkeeper,Isn't that the fella that chopped off Jamie's hand?
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Why the fuck is the sign in the Common Tongue when those fuckers were talking in Valyrian or whatever the whole time?!

That master was probably like ""the fuck does this shit say?"""
4,4,Oathkeeper,"This episode started so light (dat wide eyed Tommen yo) but then became so dark and depressing at the end. I mean, I already knew what was going down at Craster's abode, but to actually see all that rape and abuse....igh. And Ghost all caged and helpless. Summer now, too. Reminds me too much of Grey Wind's death during the Red Wedding (which was actually the part that hit me hardest--so fucking cruel and sad, man).  And then that Hodor abuse scene. And that fucking psychopath putting his hands all over Meera. If something happens to Meera I'm going to cry."
4,4,Oathkeeper,The Kingslayer Brothers would be a kickass name for a metal band.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Is that Ice Crown Citadel?
4,4,Oathkeeper,[That little finger](http://i.imgur.com/OfKHr.gif)
4,4,Oathkeeper,I feel like we're watching Littlefinger's slow transformation into Bane
4,4,Oathkeeper,Ser Pounce lives!!
4,4,Oathkeeper,Um I'm sorry was that ICE SATAN making baby wights??
4,4,Oathkeeper,Ser Pounce **HYPE**
4,4,Oathkeeper,"I never thought I'd be jealous of Tommen Lannister, but *god damn.*"
4,4,Oathkeeper,awesome shot of Dany looking over Meereen
4,4,Oathkeeper,I really like the dynamic between Jaime and Brienne. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Damn, this preview for The Leftovers is pretty nuts."
4,4,Oathkeeper,The birth of Loki. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Ser Pounce?! Did he say Ser Pounce?!  WHERE IS SER POUNCE?! Show me the kitty!

Edit: SER POOOUUNCE!!!!!'''"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"For me, Margaery is one of the most compelling female characters from any show, movie, or book.

Plus, Natalie Dormer is hot"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"I now feel that the White walkers are a thousand times more badass than the Dragons
"
4,4,Oathkeeper,Show watchers now know exactly as much about White Walkers as book readers after this episode...
4,4,Oathkeeper,How is it last week Jamie Lannister = rapist and now I really like him again??! 
4,4,Oathkeeper,Oh hey are we getting some Grey Worm/Missandei action? 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Those motherfuckers, leave Hordor alone!"
4,4,Oathkeeper,That white walker magic guy looked just like Darth Maul
4,4,Oathkeeper,What in the F is going on. Which book did this happen in?!
4,4,Oathkeeper,Littlefinger is such a snake but *damn* do I love his lines.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"""Reddit is under heavy load""  A Cat just appeared on scene with a cute girl and dorky guy on Game of Thrones.... The image may cause the device to become unstable.  "
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Suddenly, Hodor awoke in the night--afright to the sounds of a calling infant. 

""Hodor,"" he quoth."
4,4,Oathkeeper,This White Walker baby scene is...actually kind of touching
4,4,Oathkeeper,Natalie Dormer's eyes in her scene with Tommen were goddamn hypnotic. So gorgeous. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,Was that the first time we've seen a Targaryen banner? Either way it was awesome.
4,4,Oathkeeper,SER POUNCE! All is right in the world.
4,4,Oathkeeper,WILL YOU JOIN IN OUR CRUSADE? WHO WILL BE STRONG AND STAND WITH ME? SOMEWHERE BEYOND THE WALL IS THERE A WORLD YOU LONG TO SEE?
4,4,Oathkeeper,Baelish has probably seen 2000+ different sets of titties
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Holy shit , the more I see the more I realize  the perfect casting that is Natalie Dormer. Marg is made of pure Primary School Crush material. Tommen doesn't stand a fucking chance."
4,4,Oathkeeper,Sansa learning politics from the best.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Maybe I have a fuzzy memory....but I am almost done with AFFC and I have no recollection of this plotline at all. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,Sooooo all the book readers go WTF?!
4,4,Oathkeeper,Olenna Tryell is definitely one of my favorite characters.
4,4,Oathkeeper,And the most important character in *Game of Thrones* history makes his grand entrance: SER POUNCE.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"For those of you who haven't read the books, this never happened and we in /r/asoiaf are all very confused."
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Hey, do me a solid and feed this baby to some monsters. "
4,4,Oathkeeper,"So what did I just watch? That wasn't in the books, was it? "
4,4,Oathkeeper,Brienne and Pod? This could be Arya/The Hound levels of awesome.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Quick, while Cersei is distracted, fetch the kittens!"
4,4,Oathkeeper,Frozen darth maul. Best. Crossover. Ever.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"They are really giving Bronn and Jamie some great chemistry.

I'm so glad they didn't go for a replacement Ilyn Payne. :("
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Awh, he's looking for Ser Pounce. There is a bit of the Tommen I was looking for. He may not be nine and chubby, but at least he is sweet and innocent."
4,4,Oathkeeper,I actually kind of like Tommen not being a little kid. Him being old enough to develop a crush on Margaery definitely helps the Tyrell's position. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,AND HIS AXE!
4,4,Oathkeeper,The minor progression that turns to the major progression in the GoT theme song gets me everytime
4,4,Oathkeeper,"http://i.imgur.com/x21a56J.png 
Daenerys = Badass"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Why you hittin' yourself, Jaime? Stop hittin' yourself!"
4,4,Oathkeeper,So uh....White Walker Satan in Superman's crystal palace..
4,4,Oathkeeper,"So... was all that ""playing with kittens with Tommen"" in the book an innuendo that I just never got?"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"How and why is Locke at the Wall all of a sudden? Did I miss something?
"
4,4,Oathkeeper,JON AND BRAN WILL MEET. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"I'm surprised that noone is commenting on Ghost snarling and growling. I mean, it's part of why he's called ghost, he doesn't ever make a sound. No growling, no snarling, no howling, just raised hackles and then you're dead."
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Burn Gorman is doing a pretty great job as the rogue member of the Night's Watch, Karl. He manages to make the scene intense without having to do the over the top bit like Ramsay Snow. It's also great that Pacific Rim is on at the same time, so double Burn Goman love. "
4,4,Oathkeeper,Tommen looks like he has never seen a girl before
4,4,Oathkeeper,Her liver must be shot to shit.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Missandei and Shireen should tutor together.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Sharing *that* kind of conversation with your grandmother. #justwesterosthings
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Wait, how the hell did ghost get captured? Where has he been anyway?"
4,4,Oathkeeper,So. The Nazgul are in Westeros now. Great. They don't stand a chance.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Am I the only one after the Tommen-Margaery scene thought something along the lines of ""man, I did not think that scene was going to end so PG?"""
4,4,Oathkeeper,Man you book readers really love that cat
4,4,Oathkeeper,this show is turning into reading rainbow between gray worm and onion knight
4,4,Oathkeeper,Aaaand the show is definitely not going to leave that plot point ambiguous. Excellent.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Meera better not get raped. I'll turn this shit off.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Peeeeter, Peter Dinklage....."
4,4,Oathkeeper,"""M'lady""

*internet's head explodes*"
4,4,Oathkeeper,Who directed this episode? I think its the best directed episodes yet and it isn't even over.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Let Jon meet up with Bran. Thrones, just please give me that."
4,4,Oathkeeper,As a book reader the last ten minutes of the show was a long series of wtfs. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Sansa: ""Why did you kill him then?""

Littlefinger: ""#YOLO"""
4,4,Oathkeeper,It's hilarious watching the book readers at /r/asoiaf also freaking out for once.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"FUCK YEAH SER POUNCE UP IN THIS BITCH!

EDIT: Not Hodor you cunts!"
4,4,Oathkeeper,The fuck is this plotline?
4,4,Oathkeeper,LEAVE HODOR ALONE!
4,4,Oathkeeper,WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT
4,4,Oathkeeper,The fuck just happened? White Walkers turning babies into White Walkers? Where the hell were they?
4,4,Oathkeeper,Did that baby age by a month between cuts?
4,4,Oathkeeper,Some parents might end up regretting naming their children Daenerys. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,Jamie was just trying to get tommen laid by only keeping one guard by him. He rolled the dice. Close but no cigar for tommen
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Margaery, you vixen, you made Tommen harder than Valyrian steel"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"One of the special features on the Season 2 blu ray is now particularly relevant:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KHzcsLjgog"
4,4,Oathkeeper,Did the quick scene of the mutineers hurting Hodor make anyone else feel awful?
4,4,Oathkeeper,Wow this episode is really deviating from the books. Especially with what is going on up North.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Ser Pounce isn't the only cat Tommen's having tonight.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Smoking hot read head walking into his room in the middle of the night, and the first words out of his mouth are ""Mother doesn't allow visitors. Jesus Christ, Tommon, it's like you're not even trying."
4,4,Oathkeeper,"""All great swords have names, any ideas?"" ... ""Ser Pounce."""
4,4,Oathkeeper,The Queen of Thorns is bad ass. 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Oh man I thought I couldn't love a duo more than I love Arya and Hound...Brienne and Pod, are you kidding me!?"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"I actually like that Bran looks a teenager rather than a little kid.

In the show he comes off as really mature and it adds a lot of more depth to his character.

Also have to give credit to the actor who plays him really well. He's fantastic."
4,4,Oathkeeper,This scene is sweet. One of them is definitely going to die.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Ser Pounce!!!!
4,4,Oathkeeper,Crucifixion: It's what's for justice.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Darth Maul? Is that you?
4,4,Oathkeeper,FUCK YOU GUYS LEAVE HODOR ALONE 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Jesus, Summer is huge!"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Bran's just like: ""Wolf Mode, initiattteeee!"""
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Well for a change, show watchers get to see stuff we book readers never saw before."
4,4,Oathkeeper,I like how the music changed when Locke stood up.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"""Tell me a secret""
""HRNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG"""
4,4,Oathkeeper,"""I thought I wouldn't have to take orders from highborn cunts."" 
Cut to Cersei"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Olenna describing how she won Margaery's grandfather was wonderful. ""He couldn't walk the next day""....way to work it, Queen of Thorns!"
4,4,Oathkeeper,"*throughout the whole Margaery-Tommen exchange* Ohshitoshitoshitoshitoshitoshit don't. don't. don't.

No! Don't kiss him don't don't. SHE'S GONNA! NONONONONONO. Forehead. Good good. 

Christ what a tease. She has him wrapped around her finger now. "
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Littlefinger: ""Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship ***grow stronger***."" Instantly cut to Marge and the Big O walking through a sea of plant life. 

I liked that quite a lot."
4,4,Oathkeeper,Gigantic banner hanging off an eagle... I'm not sure I'm on board with Daenerys' choice of imagery.

4,4,Oathkeeper,Ice ice baby.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Cribs: White Walker Edition
4,4,Oathkeeper,No Arya in the episode was about to really disappoint me but the men in white totally made up for it! Hope she gets a lot of facetime next episode
4,4,Oathkeeper,No Oberyn this week :(
4,4,Oathkeeper,Cut to Pod looking like a doofus. Hah!
4,4,Oathkeeper,"I have no idea what Locke is up to or how he got into the Night's Watch or what he's got planned, but I got to say, I'm excited as fuck.

Locke 4 lyfe."
4,4,Oathkeeper,"So... does this mean that adorable, clumsy little white walker toddlers exist? :D"
4,4,Oathkeeper,So Brienne's mission is to somehow find the most searched after person in Westeros and... do what?
4,4,Oathkeeper,Lol Tommen thought he was going to get some
4,4,Oathkeeper,On what planet does a boy Tommen's age just turn over and go to sleep after an encounter like that?  I'm pretty sure he'd have masturbated himself raw by morning.

4,4,Oathkeeper,Michelle MacLaren is really the best director for television.
4,4,Oathkeeper,That White Walker Baby scene gave me the chills.
4,4,Oathkeeper,"Surprisingly, I actually kind of like what they're doing with Bran's arc. It's a good way for them to slow down his storyline, which looked like it was very on pace to get past the books. The extra insight on the White Walkers is also really nice. It's nice to see the Land of Always Winter and know more about the White Walkers. "
4,4,Oathkeeper,Favourite characters as of now: Bronn and Ser Pounce.
4,4,Oathkeeper,Jon Snow's new friend. That actor is in the show before this. Where do we see him? 
4,4,Oathkeeper,"I got a total Spartacus vibe during the speech underneath Mereen.

grand slam by Grey Worm."
4,4,Oathkeeper,Anyone else think that Littlefinger sounds more and more like Bane with each episode? I expect him to show up to the Vale wearing the mask and everything.

4,4,Oathkeeper,Does anyone agree with me that this was probably one of the greatest episodes of this show so far?
4,4,Oathkeeper,I predict Ser Pounce will emerge as a top 10 name for cats. I am considering getting one just to give it that name.

There will be glorious peace. 

Dany will come to Westeros and learn she can buy it for a fair price (from the Wall to the beaches of Dorne for a kajillion gold dragons!) with a competitive interest rate, if she'd care to take out a loan towards its purchase and all three dragons as collateral..."

Of course they still *have* gold but their mines have run dry?  Holy shit!

"
4,5,First of His Name,"My favourite part of this episode was the contrast between Locke and Jon. Locke let those women be raped and likely murdered while he did recon on Craster's, highlighting his pragmatism and malevolence. Jon, on the other hand, knew that the keep was their best shelter and he could damn well burn it down the next morning, but for the sake of the ladies he complied immediately. Really takes after Ned.

4,5,First of His Name,I hope show watchers didn't miss the importance of that conversation.  Petyr arranged for the murder of Jon Arryn which basically put all of the series's events in motion.  
4,5,First of His Name,Gross.
4,5,First of His Name,"Some of the more fickle readers will probably be upset about this battle scene at Crasters because it was a new scene, but holy shit that was amazing. I was on the edge of my seat. "
4,5,First of His Name,"I knew Lysa was nuts, but...well, there's OAG and then there's whatever the fuck that was."
4,5,First of His Name,"Now I understand why they made this change from the books, because that made for a very good scene."
4,5,First of His Name,Gave that bitch some boats. Bitches love boats.
4,5,First of His Name,"**Revelation of Arryn's murder!**

That's the problem....**I wonder if show watchers realize that the thing that kick-started all the chaos -- Arryn's death -- was just revealed as a *murder*.  It's probably long forgotten and insignificant to those who didn't read the books.**

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

* **EDIT**:   I hope I didn't disrespect any show-watchers -- I was a show-watcher.  I watched it on **HBO GO, where they don't show the ""Previously On..."" recaps**... so I thought show-watchers wouldn't be able to remember Arryn, since he was dead before the show started and hasn't been mentioned in almost 30 episodes.

I'm seriously amazed that there are show-watchers who -- at *any* point prior to this episode -- thought to themselves, ""About Jon Arryn... what if he got murdered?"".... especially since no one in Westeros asked that question.

* **EDIT 2**: Apparently, I'm being a dick for making a ""heavy implication"" that ""readers are dense.""  

To clarify, **the purpose of my post was to slightly lament the possibility that there are viewers who might not have recalled who Jon Arryn was, thus missing out on the ""WOW""-factor of the murder-conspiracy revelation by LF.**  As in, I was hoping that those viewers wouldn't miss out on a pretty entertaining and critical reveal in the show, since we're all sharing this viewing experience.  

And remember, I was writing all of the original post in real time while watching the show.  I won't change the original post, only because I don't want to hide the ""un-besmirched"" version.  I'm not ashamed of the post, but I am regretful that I seemed to have offended so many people with a post that was sincerely well-intended.  

**Like I said, it's a shared viewing experience, and I didn't want anyone ""missing out"" on the best parts of the episode.**

Lastly...

* **It's like the Night's King reveal last week.  That was a HUGE reveal, regardless of whether you read the books or not.  ""HUGE"" is a severe understatement.  It was a monumental, historic, epic shock because it was ""new material"" that's likely not going to be in the books.  It was arguably a bigger deal to book readers than to show watchers, largely because this seems to confirm some theories out there that can only be raised by reading the books.  It has NOTHING to do with ""holier than thou"" or perceived ""elitism,"" and EVERYTHING to do with ""there's currently more reading material than what has been shown in the series"" -- making it a WOW factor.**"

4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Time for Tyrion's smart mouth to get him into trouble.

4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,"And who are you, the proud lord said, that I should bow so low... 
That monologue had me cheering.... Peter Dinklage blew me away. "
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Loved Oberyn just trolling the court. Only piping up when sex was remotely mentioned 
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Aww... Tommen looks so cute on the Iron Throne.

Shae burn in hell."
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,I can already tell this trial is going to be infuriating to watch. 
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,"Dinklage had something personal in that performance. Moving.

But Charles Dance gave that same stone cold look that he did after Joffrey died.

Man."
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,"Can I just say I'm thrilled by the guy who is playing Oberyn.  At first I was a bit surprised by the casting, but every scene he's been in, he's just owned it.  Seeing both him and Varys in a scene together was fantastic."
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,"Ramsay portrays complete fucking psychopathy like, incredibly well. I wonder if his actor is a little cray in real life..."
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Mycroft Holmes runs the Bank of Braavos

Aaaaaaand... It's gone. "
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,YES HE DESERVED TO DIE AND I HOPE HE BURNED IN THE SEVEN HELLS!
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Peter dinklage just killed it! Best ep of the season so far IMO 
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,"And with that, Peter Dinklage has elevated Game of Thrones into a whole new stratosphere. What an amazing freaking scene."
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,"GreyJoy in the previews, so we'll finally be seeing Theon's sister fuck shit up"

4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Peter Dinklage is a god among men. That was a Bryan Cranston-level performance. If he doesn't win the emmy there's no justice.
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Well we found Dinklage's Emmy submission.
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,"The fact that Cersei seems to be the only one in that small council that isn't taking Dany (who has MOTHERFUCKING DRAGONS) seriously speaks volumes to how she isn't as smart as she thinks she is.

I loved the Varys scenes this episode though. I think this is the first episode since season one that reminds people that he has been backing Danny behind the scenes (with his nudge to the throne). [Reminder from Season 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwJ52fiZ8JI)"
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,the brown pants joke! it goes back pretty far doesn't it?
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,I think Peter Dinklage might have just got himself another Emmy
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,arya better add shae to her list b/c she just moved to the top of mine
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Anyone notice how Margaery was continuously shifting uncomfortably during the ~~kangaroo court~~ trial? Tyrion chained in the box when it was all Grandma dearest's doing. 
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,"Alternative ending: ""I request a trial by dance off""  (Oberyn and Ser Loris enter)"
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,Can we take a break from the Shae hate long enough to acknowledge that Peter Dinklage is fucking amazing?

4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,"I was hanging off the edge of my seat with the whole Tyrion trial thing, as someone who doesn't read the books, I honestly thought that Shae had gotten to him and that he had just given up. Now the question is who will fight for him? Jamie or Bronn?"
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,"Ok, Dinklage just blew the most powerful dialogue in the book out of the fucking park.


That was exactly as good as I hoped it to be! Holy fuck!"
4,6,The Laws of Gods and Men,"I think Davos may be the origin of the phrase ""Talk to the Hand""."

But the moment where Ramsay was slowly opening the cage of the dogs seemed so ridiculous. Instead of letting him finish his little speech and getting the key for the cage, just rush into him and slash him open. He's not even wearing a shirt for crying out loud! These moments really break the immersion for me.

4,7,Mockingbird,"Bronn had the nicest ""betrayal"" in the show. He didn't need to give his reasoning behind not fighting for Tyrion, but came to say goodbye anyways. The two are friends, but Tyrion still pays for Bronn's services with gold and never did anything beyond that for him. Though as Tyrion said it's because Bronn is a cold hearted bastard that he likes him so there was nothing to apologize for. I would have understood Bronn refusing to fight even without being bribed by Cersei and Tyrion being unable to pay, it's the Mountain, Bronn would be going in the fight knowing he would probably die unlike the fight at the Vale which was more even."

4,7,Mockingbird,Sansa just cannot catch a break. She's handling her life turning upside down repeatedly pretty well.

4,7,Mockingbird,"I wonder how the death of his mom is going to affect Robyn. It seems he doesn't have a very good grasp on death. The permanence of his moms death is going to hit him pretty hard, that is if Littlefinger doesn't get to him first. (I don't think Baelish would hurt him at this point though)"

"
4,7,Mockingbird,"So at the Eyrie... where the hell is everybody? You go any other Hold and there are tons of civilians, guards, servants, council... is the Eyrie as empty as it seems? "
4,7,Mockingbird,[deleted]
4,7,Mockingbird,"Aww, another wolf-cookie! <3

I hope Arya is reunited with Hot Pie and Gendry before the series ends."
4,7,Mockingbird,Its pretty amazing to see how well Littlefinger can play the game and change the course of history. I found him to be a bit odd in the first season but now he has become my favorite character.
4,7,Mockingbird,"Man, waiting two weeks for Oberyn v. The Mountain is only going to make me more excited.  IS IT TIME YET?"
4,7,Mockingbird,"Petyr is such a calculating, manipulative character. Was his kiss of Sansa another calculation to create the scenario it did...a vulnerable grieving wife next to an open moon door?  I mean right there in her court yard he conducted such a display. He does not come off as a man so easily tempted without a larger agenda. Perhaps I'm reading to much into it. "
4,7,Mockingbird,[removed]
4,7,Mockingbird,I loved Brienne's look to Podrick when Hot Pie gave them information about Arya after Pod told her not to mention looking for Sansa.
4,7,Mockingbird,Never give up on the gravy.
4,7,Mockingbird,BROBERYN
4,7,Mockingbird,Didn't even realize they changed the mountain until I read about it today. I just thought I was tripping out or something. 
4,7,Mockingbird,"I love watching the Hound and Arya's relationship develop. Him opening up to her about his past with his brother and her hatred toward him thawing slightly is so weirdly adorable. These are probably my favorite parts of the new season now. I used to love the Daenerys scenes, but now I feel really bored by them. "
4,7,Mockingbird,"Can we all just take a second to appreciate what an amazing job Kate Dickie did? Even if I won't miss her character, I'll certainly miss *her.* She was the *perfect* Lysa. She came off as so unhinged, but it was so believable. She was only in, what, five episodes? But she fucking *owned* her character in every single one of those episodes. Like Harry Lloyd (Viserys), she's a member of the cast who I think will largely be overlooked and forgotten simply due to the character having a small presence, so I really want to just give her the recognition and respect that she deserves. I would not have responded nearly as strongly to Lysa if it weren't for Kate's performance."
4,7,Mockingbird,"Oberyn's dialog with Tyrion was just spectacular. The emotion that Oberyn elicited from Tyrion when he said, ""That's no little monster, that's just a baby"" was absolutely fantastic "
4,7,Mockingbird,"""What did you do with all the bad people and the people you didn't like?""
""We didn't do anything with them.""

House Stark ladies and gents "
4,7,Mockingbird,"This was honestly up there as one of my favorite episodes. I loved the hot pie appearance and his encounters with Brienne and pod, also the Tyrion and Oberyn scene couldn't have been better. And even though lysa's death in the books went a little differently, that scene was a fantastic ending.  All in all it's pretty much impossible to wait two weeks for the mountain vs red viper duel, I have to push through! "
4,7,Mockingbird,[removed]
4,7,Mockingbird,"All of Tyrion's scenes were fantastic and evoked so much emotion. It will be a massive crime if he isn't somehow recognised for his performance this season.

Speaking of emotion, Sandor talking about how Gregor burned him was also fantastic.

I kind of wish we'd seen more of Lysa Arryn before she flew, but I'm glad they didn't butcher her death as much as some people thought they might. Kate Dickie is a truly fantastic actor.

I'm also happy to get a bit more of Jorah this episode, him and Barristan are two of my favourite characters and I'm interested to see what D&D are going to do with them in the future.

Hot Pie coming back was a fantastic surprise.

Overall the worst parts of the episode (which weren't even that bad) were lacking in quality because of how silly they were. Yes the Mountain is a murderous brute, but I'm sure he doesn't spend his spare time butchering peasants. And Arya stabbing Rorge was similar - the strangeness of that situation took away from it a bit. Seriously, the dude just stood there and got stabbed, didn't even flinch before the blade went in."
4,7,Mockingbird,I just loved that ending so much. I never liked Littlefinger but this episode changed my mind. That was so crafty.
4,7,Mockingbird,[removed]
4,7,Mockingbird,Damn this two week break. You're killing me Game of Thrones. 
4,7,Mockingbird,"I wanted to take Tywin's POV from the upcoming trial by combat, seeing as he has so much invested in it, and thought he had the perfect set-up before.

If Oberyn wins: Tyrion lives and still gives Tywin hope for an heir, although with Sansa missing this is an issue. Tyrion is still smart and useful as well, Tywin has seen that, despite his hatred for him. Cersei would be tough to deal with though if Tyrion is still around. Also, Oberyn killing the Mountain could potentially put Tywin to ease, since Oberyn is so unpredictable and powerful. Giving him the seat on the council and vengeance could net an ally. He would lose the Mountain though, who is Tywin's boy for when it comes to dirty work.

If the Mountain wins: Tywin no longer has to see Tyrion again, and despite Tyrion's useful intelligence, he is still the ugly imp who killed Joanna. However, that also means that Tywin needs some other way of getting Jaime to leave the kingsguard, which he probably would not do. Oberyn's death could also be a positive, since Tywin may fear Oberyn would still seek vengeance if he lived."

4,7,Mockingbird,"So....if Littlefinger had actually kept the ""Only Cat"" line, how many show watchers would have thought he killed Lysa out of love for his majesty, first of his name, Ser Pounce? That must be why D&D changed the line. "
4,7,Mockingbird,[deleted]
4,7,Mockingbird,"I'm so glad we got to behold The Pie that was Promised, it really helped soothe the pain of losing Lysa Arryn."
4,7,Mockingbird,"I feel like, in terms of emotional development of the characters, this episode holds the number one spot.  In no other episode do we so the kind of tear jerking, character revealing content then we do in ""Mocking Bird"".  Can't wait to see the Oberyn-Mountain battle two weeks from now."
4,7,Mockingbird,Finally a happy death!
4,7,Mockingbird,"I honestly felt underwhelmed by the Lysa death scene. It just felt rushed compared to the books, where we it contained a lot more character development, suspense, and tension. I don't think non-readers will view it as being as big a moment as Tyrion's trial last week or his new trial next episode, when in the books it was just about the biggest and most climactic moment there was outside of the Red Wedding. I wish I'd enjoyed it more but.. I dunno, rushed is the only word for it, I feel like it had the bare minimum of what it could have had.

I did really enjoy Oberyn and Hot Pie this week, though."
4,7,Mockingbird,We're soarin! Flyin! There's not a star in heaven that w-  *splat!* 
4,7,Mockingbird,Plot twists everywhere! 0_o
4,7,Mockingbird,If Oberyn keeps this up I might have  switch my banner to House Martell...
4,7,Mockingbird,"Damn, this episode was better than I expected! Glad we got to see Hot Pie again. I'm glad he's making wolf-bread that actually looks like a wolf.

As for the main event of the episode in the Eyrie, I'm so glad we got to see Sansa's snow-Winterfell, but even more so that we got to see Lysa fly. She really peaked at maximum crazy this episode. I fucking love Baelish.

Still, it sucks we have to have a week break now because I seriously can't wait for Oberyn vs The Mountain!

[ASOS](#b "" ""And then I smashed her fucking head in. Like this!"" - If they keep that in the show, it's going to be wonderfully sickening. Pedro Pascal has been amazing as Oberyn this season!"")"
4,7,Mockingbird,"I really like how Arya is modeling after The Hound.  The Hound stabs the wounded guy to put him out of his pain, and proceeds to wipe his blood off on the guys rags and then states ""That's where the heart is..  That's how you kill a man"".  

Moments later after they get attacked, Arya immediately stabs Rorge in the heart, and proceeds to wipe the blood off on his rag.

:)"
4,7,Mockingbird,"I was pretty irked that Littlefinger's line when he pushes Lysa was changed. ""Only Cat"" is just so iconic, I didn't think it needed to be changed, but I guess I understand why that was done. That said, this episode was super awesome, if only because of those amazing scenes in Tyrion's cell.

Super psyched to see Viper vs. Mountain, and the rest of this season. It's going to be a whirlwind of phenomenal television."
4,7,Mockingbird,"I'm not liking the look of The Mountain. His size has definitely been nailed, but his face is too... how do I put it... *nice*? His brother looks proper nasty, while this fellow actually has pleasant, round features."
4,7,Mockingbird,This season is getting incredible by every episode.
4,7,Mockingbird,Pretty blown away with having probably the finest performer of Samuel Beckett's work do some of Waiting For Godot with Arya and Hound...

4,7,Mockingbird,"Bronn is STILL my favourite! Went from a common sell sword to being knighted to running shit in his own dominion, talk about rags to bitches. Anyone saying he betrayed Tyrion is short sighted. if Tyrion had his way Bronn would have to fight the Mountain, Bronn can't beat the Mountain, Bronn knows this, if Tyrion was as smart as he says it is he should know it too. Any man of ""honour"" would have fought a losing battle to uphold his name. But whats in a name? Who sings songs for the people the Mountain has killed? Who sings songs about motherfucking gangsters?"

[ASOS] (#g ""I have a theory as to why they decide to have Jon Snow argue FOR the sealing of the Tunnel under the Wall.

4,7,Mockingbird,Does anyone know if there is a deeper reason as to why the commander of the Black tells Snow to lock up Ghost?  Didn't Ghost detect the first undead?
4,7,Mockingbird,"So I have a question, and unfortunately, I have not read the books but...

Tyrion is on trial and wants a trial by combat. If Tyrion's champion loses then they both die. If Tyrion's champion wins and the champion of the crown is killed, does the person who chose that champion die as well?"

Idk how fond he's going to be of his family (aside from jaime) after the trial but let's say somehow they do manage to rule winterfell and tyrion has kids with sansa but doesn't want the lannister name to go on because you know he hates em and all. Can he give the kids the stark last name instead? "
4,7,Mockingbird,Re: the Mountain recasting. I know it has been hacked to death but the dark features/black beard is part of what made him menacing. The previous two had a completely different look...I'm happy this new actor is getting the chance but I wish they had stayed consistent on the physical appearance of the character.

4,7,Mockingbird,"Usually the episodes feel so short to me, but this one seemed to go on forever!

Shortly after a raven will arrive in King's Landing with a confession from Petyr Baelish claiming to have single-handedly killed King Joffrey. This causes serious chaos within house Lannister.

Stannis sits on the throne. The wildlings break the Night's watch and themselves in a battle with no clear winner. Both sides are left unable to mount an effective defense as the white walker army (remember it?) heads south of the wall. And then the season ends."")"

4,7,Mockingbird,"The final Oberyn/Tyrion scene, Oberyn is talking about visiting Casterly Rock some time ago. How many years ago was that/how old are they both?"
4,7,Mockingbird,"Maybe Oberyn was sent by Tywin? He did promise such a ""meeting"" with the mountain. Also either way Tywin benefits. ""Leave it to father to find a way to benefit from a family tragedy ... """

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"In this episode we lost Oberyn, Sansa's ~~soul~~ innocence (if there was any left), Jorah's heart, probably Tyrion's life (edit: Arya's mind?). Really hitting a variety of wounds here. And yet my favorite part is still Arya's laugh. 

""Of course she's dead. Why wouldn't she be dead? Everyone is dead."""
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,This hits me a lot harder than the Red Wedding.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,I cannot stop replaying the image of Oberyn's head splattering in my head.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I'm not sure I can take much more of this. The breaks between seasons make me forget about GRRM and his ways, and every season I'm harshly reminded. Holy shit was Oberyn's death terrifying though. Hearing a scream from a personality like his is truly spine chilling, and the gore of his death sent it way over the top for me. It makes sense that it ended where it did, but fucking hell do I hate leaving it for a week on that note. Oberyn will certainly be missed, but now I only wonder if Tyrion will magically pull a scapegoat out of his hat, though after that brutal slaying, I truly doubt it."

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"This fight is on par with Ned's execution and Red Wedding in terms of the magnitude of events. I wonder if anything can ever outmatch it.

This show's attention to detail never ceases to amaze me. Sansa's dresses often had more than one motive - it was direwolves and flowers, fishes and lions, and now it's a full blown mockingbird, but the details on her chest stil resemble fish scales (much like the Tully armour).

Then there's Arya's laugh, which just about sums her life story so far. Father in sight? Nope. Brother and mother just behind the door? Nay, nope. Home? Closed until renovation. Oh, you were about to meet up with your aunt? Too bad, here, she's dead now.

After seeing how the show alternatives turned out, I'm starting to have faith in ""filler"" material.

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Bronn hit the nail on the head with the viper's fight. He said he'd beat the Mountain with a spear, try to stay quick and poke and prod him until he found an opening, but one wrong move and it'd be over.

Oberyn used his fancy long spear twirling to stay a step ahead of the mountain. He poked and prodded until he found an opening to hamstring the big lug, the went in for the kill. But then, well, one wrong move and it was over."

Let him bleed out."" *BUT NOOOOO* he **HAD** to move closer to him. The Mountain might as well have crushed my heart with his giant fingers."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Player Sansa has entered the game.  I'm excited to see her develop in this new direction. 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"The only thing that slightly makes up for that awful death is that Oberyn did get the confession from the Mountain. With that confession and combined with Dorne's hatred for the Lannisters and the death of their beloved prince, it's time for the Lannisters to sweat because the Martells have Myrcella."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I knew what was coming and I'm still in shock about the way that episode ended. It was just so shockingly gruesome and perfect. And fuck, lots of other really important happened with Jorah, the Wildlings getting ready to attack, Sansa becoming awesome, and that fucking laugh from Arya. Can't wait to watch the last two. It will be hard to top the shock value of this one, but I'm excited to see them try!

My reaction after the fight: http://i.imgur.com/YcAQlkx.gif"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I knew Oberyn was going die about 5 minutes before it happened.  The scene with the Hound and Arya could've really gone anywhere in the episode, in the beginning, middle, or end...but they put it right before the fight scene.  Why? Because that scene was intended to put you in a good mood, Arya laughing hysterically, the Hound giving the ""are you fucking serious face"" made me literally laugh out loud.  Then the fight scene came, Pycelle rambling and everything then it was like, damn Oberyn's gonna lose."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,I feel like the guy at the beginning who had one of his eyes taken out was some sort of discreet foreshadowing.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Chalk up another reason for me to want The Mountain dead. Oberyn might've been acting foolish, but the giant fucker did not deserve that victory and Oberyn had literally 0 chance to realize his mistake and prevent it. Gaps between seasons always cause me to forget the cruel yet realistic storytelling of GRRM."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,I loved the subtle inclusion of Oberyn's squire wiping down the tip of the spear right before the fight. He was called the red viper for a reason.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I haven't been this angry/sad/upset over a character's death since Ned's.

The Red Wedding sucked, no doubt about it, but oh my gods. That *scream* is what killed me. I had to cover my eyes and actually began crying when it was all over. "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,That was SO MUCH MORE BRUTAL than I imagined when I read the books. I'm in trauma. 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I just realized that before the duel Tyrion tells Oberyn ""At least wear a helmet"".

Oh how much that would have helped. Wearing helmets saves lives."

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"To me, that was worse than the Red Wedding. By far. I actually thought I was going to throw up. I really liked this character and I FELT the joy and the relief that was expected- and then, in seconds- it was torn away and replaced by the most gruesome, gratuitous death scene I've ever witnessed. The whole scenario was beyond my level of taste. Even now, I find it difficult to think about."

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,10/10 would watch again
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Because I'm a sick person, I decided to watch the head-splosion in slow motion. I wanted to see how they cut the shot to get the maximum impact on the audience.

Then I realised that when the Mountain is roaring his confession, the camera takes the focus off him, and focuses on Cersei in the background. Why would it do that at such an important moment? 

Because it Cersei who gave the order for the Mountain to brutalise Elia Martell. Not Tywin. 

Years earlier, Tywin promised Cersei that she would marry Rhaegar Targaryen and would become King. Cersei became infatuated with Rhaegar and excited by the prospect, but then King Aerys married Rhaegar off to Elia Martell. 

Tywin didn't have much to gain from Elia's death.  Tywin plays everyone in Westeros (including his children) like pieces on a chessboard, using every piece to further his goals until they have exhausted their usefulness. Elia would have been more valuable alive, as a bartering chip to ensure Dorne's loyalty.

Cersei is spiteful enough to have said to the Mountain, ""If you see that bitch who stole my chance to be Queen, smash her head in."" 

This explains why Cersei personally greeted the Mountain when he returned to Kings Landing. She spoke as a woman who has used his special brand of violence to her personal advantage. There was some kind of connection there, as though they shared a secret together. 

So my theory is - Tywin never confessed to ordering the Mountain to kill Elia Martell, because he didn't. Cersei was the one whom instructed the Mountain to kill her.  

EDIT: I rewatched the scene, and it looks like as it swaps focus from the Mountain to Cersei, it does the same with Oberyn and Tyrion - so maybe it was just drawing contrast between the two champions, and the two people they are representing. However, I still firmly believe that Cersei was more likely to have given the order regarding Elia than Tywin."

#lovecanmovemountains"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"i'm well too late to this post but I need to vent my feelings on the duel for my own cathartic purposes. Having read the books i was fully aware of what was going to come and had been anticipating the duel all season as it stands as my favourite passage in the books to date, G.R.R.M's escalation of Oberyn's interrogation of The Mountain was perfect and when defeat is snatched so brutally from the jaws of victory i was as aghast as everyone. Regardless i was looking forward to the episode to appreciate how the show handled it and if they'd be able to match the Red Wedding for shock factor.
    Let me tell you this, no amount of reading that passage prepares you for the screams of a man's skull being caved in and the crunch of the bone giving way. Pascal's portrayal of the character was affable and so well thought out I hadn't even anticipated how devastating watching that scene would be. I'm now dealing with the twin feelings of ""holy motherfucking Christ that was brutal, his skull fucking caved like a shitting PUMPKIN"" and ""you should feel terrible for looking forward to this bit"". 
    Overall a massive congratulations to Pascal, the prosthetics team, and everyone involved in the show for crippling me emotionally for a few days and still managing to be the perfect compliment to the books.
TL;DR read the books, still blown away by the duel, may investigate surgical removal of emotions before continuing "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"The way that Sansa ""confession"" scene was played out was fucking awesome. At first she's like, ""I have to tell the truth,"" so I'm here thinking that she actually isn't but she wants them to think she is. But then, she starts telling them her name is actually Sansa Stark and I'm like, ""HOLY SHIT SHE'S ACTUALLY TELLING THEM."" And then she fucking lies and then tells the truth about kissing and during that whole thing I didn't know if she was going to screw Baelish over or not until the end. Amazing."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Why am I even watching this show.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"The most interesting deviations from the book have involved Sansa. The book version of the queen's murder was very Littlefinger: have a witness there you can blame it on.  The show's version allowed Sansa's character to go from a pawn to actually being a player. In that vein, the book didn't have Sansa dress and dye her hair to give Littlefinger what he wants: her mother. The TV Sansa has become much more manipulative-- to the character and show's benefit."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,I think we can all agree that this episode was mind-blowing. 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,I am cheering for Greyworm...i'm so nervous about these feelings 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I had a terrible feeling as a non reader that this was where Oberyn was going to die. It was spoiled for me that he dies by someone that has read the books that he does die at some point, so I knew that it would eventually happen but I was hoping it wasn't so soon.

He should have just double tapped like in Zombieland or Pacific Rim before pursuing a confession. Something more than a chest wound and a hamstring slash.

It also surprises me that Oberyn didn't have a dagger anywhere on his person to stab him in the neck woth. You would think that Oberyn would know he was fucked if he were on his back with the Mountain on top of him. Besides having an extra weapon there is nothing Oberyn could have possible done once he's on his back."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Fuck the Mountain. 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Now that Sansa is in the game I hope Tyrion somehow lives to see her again....The marriage was weird but I feel like they are kindred spirits somehow and together could do pretty well free from KL
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,[removed]
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Aria laughing after her aunt died was my favorite scene of hers 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,WHERE IS GENDRY !??? He hasn't been in this season at all! 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"As a careless book reader I don't even remember who Oberyn is when I reached the scene. Yet the scene was so brutal and the man's repeating accusation was so powerful. Then years later I came to the show... I really like the man. I didn't know what's gonna happen to him, because, umm, I forgot. Until he went to Tyrion's cell... That's a end of the world moment for me. You were full of hope, and suddenly you knew his fate in great detail like a prophecy, yet none of them had happened, yet.."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I may be way off on this one, but I think that there's two ways Tyrion might still live. 

1. Hopefully Tywin still holds up his end of the deal with Jamie and Tyrion goes to the Night's Watch. I think it could be possible, due to my vague memory of Ned Stark possibly being pardoned by the king just before execution after he had admitted to lying and was found guilty. Maybe Tommen will be more merciful then Tywin is. 
2. Bronn breaks him out of jail and runs away with him, they have lots and lots of awesome adventures in Essos and live forever. 

At least I freaking hope I'm right.^probably ^no ^chance ^of ^#2 ^though 

I just don't know if I could handle losing Tyrion too.

In any case, now I know what it's like to be in an abusive relationship. GRRM keeps hurting me but I just keep coming back.... When he's good he's the best, but he hardly ever is... It's mostly just abuse. 
"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,The Hound cant catch a break
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,That ending gave me an anxiety attack..   
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Soooooo....Jaime was nearly molested at a young age...
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"So, out of just general curiosity, is it within realistic human capacity (even at the extreme, strongman-level human physique/conditioning) that a human skull could be crushed so completely, with nothing more than bare hands?  I somehow doubt that even someone of the Mountain's size would have the necessary torque in their hands.

Try crushing a raw egg in your hand if you doubt me."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Well, this show is almost predictable even if you haven't read the books. Start to like a character? 90% chance they die. 

RIP Oberyn

Also, I'm rooting for the Lannisters now. Seems like whoever I want to win dies, so by that logic... Go Cersei! "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"The ending of this episode is something that I don't ever wish to see again. It was so brutal, I think I'm scarred for life. "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"this episode has finally taught me not to pick a favourite character, they all end up dying."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Did anyone else feel really disturbed and sick to your stomach for the rest of the day after watching the end of that episode? This is the first time in a long time that I can't get images like that out of my head. 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I just got past the trial by combat in the books. I knew it was coming, the whole sequence of events. Yet, that was as close as I've come to losing my lunch watching a TV show. I think it was the sound that did me in."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I'm curious the implications on Princess Marcella, now that the Prince Oberyn has been killed pretty much at the hands of Cersei..."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"""The pillar and the stones"" made me laugh as much as Arya"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Nobody is talking about this scene? http://i.imgur.com/pPSOiQc.gif
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Oberyn's death was possibly the most chilling thing I've seen on TV in a long time. It was such a horrible way to go, and I was literally sitting staring at my screen for about a minute after it happened, just trying to process it. Such a gruesome death for such a likable character."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Everyone talks about Oberyn's screams in reference to his death, but when I watched it, I didn't register that he was screaming. My whole mind like exploded with everything. I just sat there with my jaw on the floor attempting to process what I had just scene. Oberyn was so awesome, it was a shame and (in my opinion) a waste to kill him so soon."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Missabdei's ass shocked me more than anything this episode. Dat body jesus.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"So has anyone wondered what Tywin is getting out of all of this now? Oberyn is dead, which I'm assuming destroys any hopes of gaining Dorne as an ally, something that Tywin clearly wanted. And if Tyrion really does get executed Jamie won't honor his end of the agreement either? So Tywin has actually failed at taking advantage of a family tragedy?"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Can I just mini-rant that it *very slightly* dims my enjoyment of GoT when the only person I know who also watches the show is so ""whatever"" about it?

Every Monday morning I ask my friend what she thinks and post-Oberyn vs. The Mountain, post-Red Wedding, post-Joffrey's wedding, she always laughs and responds with ""Yeah, that was pretty crazy."" The end.

WHY DOES THIS DRIVE ME NUTS

SHOW SOME EMOTION

IT'S KILLING ME"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I know all you guys are sad and everything but I just know that Oberyn is like that character that can't die… And.. And.. the beginning of the next episode is his head rebuilding itself.. cuz… cuz.. snakes are reptiles and reptiles regenerate limbs, right?… And.. And.. everything is going to be awesome because he'll be back...

(rocks back and forth in the corner)

You'll see.. it's going to be great. *sniff"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"What I loved about Oberyn was that he cool/cocky/powerful and *good*. Real goodness in the hands of the powerful (or real power in the hands of the good) gives me such *hope*. And to see that literally crushed by the hands of its opposite was devastating. 

The Mountain isn't really evil - not like the White Walker King. He's just a sociopath. Which makes it so much worse. "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Everyone was worried about the crunch and Oberyn's lines. Personally I was more worried about the Mountain's lines not making it. I am delighted. ""Some dead man"" , ""LIKE THIS"".

Chills ..."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,My eyeballs hurt.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"One thing I only picked up on my 2nd viewing was the ""she was an odd fish"" comment the female Vale elder Lady made was clever because Lysa was originally a Tully (and thus a 'fish').

The show makers have really done a great job in layering all the symbolism of all the various house sigils."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"One thing after going back and re-watching the scene when Oberyn says he will be Tyrion's champion: they really didn't do a good job in the show of proving how badass Oberyn was.  Sure, they gave him confidence, and swagger, and a goal, but the training, his fighting history, etc was almost all ignored.  When he volunteered to fight the mountain, it seemed almost suicidal.  Like 'hey, that's a great gesture, and it's great that you're trying to avenge your sister, but LOLOLOLOLOL'.  Then he went out and completely dominated the fight until making his mistake.  I would have liked for them to touch on his history and reputation a bit more before the fight.  Then maybe him getting the upper hand wouldn't have been so completely unexpected."

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Was anyone reminded of The Princess Bride by Oberyn?
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"One part that has been overlooked is Jorah's dismissal. I thought it was well done, although I don't remember exactly how it went in the books. Both Iain Glen and Emilia Clarke acted fantastically in that scene."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I'm honestly speechless. Props to Martin, the directors and the cast. That fight had me on the edge of my seat, and then I fell off."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Peter Dinklage is nailing every single monologue. 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Once the credits rolled I remembered it was Game of Thrones.

RIP"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Why couldn't you just stick the spear into his head oberyn I know you wanted answers but you should've just killed him
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I have read all the books so I knew this was coming. The actor who played the Viper was fantastic and he was able to make the character much more likable than the books. 

I am kind of mad how that fight was played out in the TV show. He had his opponent on the ground. He had a long spear all he had to do was walk up to where the mountain's head was and stab his spearpoint into the neck and/or cut a carotid artery and have him bleed out. There was no reason for him to be standing so close to his fallen opponent. I know he wanted the confession but I also think he would be more concerned about his own life, him being a human and all. I don't think a nonfictional trained fighter would have done this and it destroys suspension of disbelief. 

Monologuing and turning your back to your fallen opponent guarantees your death in the fictional world, I cringed when I saw that. And I think that AGOT is an excellent show they should have done something more original to build suspense.   

All that said I cannot wait until the next 2 shows!

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion can't die...can he? I thought he was a huge part of the series. This is going to to suck. 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I think that because of how and when Oberyn died, he will actually be more of a factor in the show than if had he lived. If he had killed the mountain he would have done what his character came to kings landing to do. Now, since he died, he has become a martyr. And Prince Martell is gonna come and rain fire on them lannister motherfuckers . 

Edit: Dorne doesn't have kings"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,This episode left me shocked and my soul crushed. If they kill off Tyrian there's almost no reason for me I watch the show . But there's always khaleesi!
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"In other non-head exploding news...

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Sansa told Littlefinger that she knew what he wanted. Does that mean he's finally going to get it?
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,I have nothing to add... but to just point out... That THIS IS BULLSHIT!
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Haven't seen this on here yet so I'll bring it up, does anyone else think that The Hound's gonna pull a Khal Drogo and die from his wound? I mean it was brought up again this episode"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"For some reason, Oberyn Martell's death impacted me more than the Red Wedding.

I just can't stop thinking about the final moment hours after finishing the episode..

Fuck you Mr. George R.R. Martin."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,The Red Wedding was nothing compared to this. It's not even because he died but because he was killed so brutally by the guy who killed his sister and her children. And the screaming..I don't think I'll ever be able to forget that.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Arya's laugh when she hears about Lysa's death :')

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I think I've got it. In order to survive this show, you've got to root for the most terrible villains. That way, when good guys die you saw it coming, and when the villains die, you can then finally stop with the defense mechanism and be like ""HA! Take that to the hilt, you sons of bitches!"" 

My brain is rocking back and forth on the floor, muttering to itself."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Turns out ""The Mountain that rides"" is short for ""The Mountain that rides over your hopes and dreams."""
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"That was the first and last time I will ever put so much trust into a TV character's survival. Even after reading the vague tweets by Pedro Pascal, I still believed Oberyn would win, then go on to slowly get revenge on all the Lannisters before becoming the king of Westeros. Now I can't stop thinking about how great that ideal would have been, how there'll probably never be an Oberyn spinoff, and how much I hated Cersei."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"As much as the spear-play from Oberyn was awesome, am I only one that feels like the sword-play from the Mountain sucked ? He mainly just swung it in front of him like a toddler with a stick. I miss season 1 Mountain :("
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Everything said in this god damn show foreshadows something bad.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I really liked the implications of the smashing beetles story. Deprived of rational thought, does the mind of man default to senseless killing of those weaker than he, for pleasure?"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"His reversal, going from super cocky and confident and then screaming for life while being told his killer raped his sister and killed her children...

If the Mountain survived somehow, I hope he gets the worst death in the show. Fuck Cersei, Walder Frey, Ramsay. They're all different evils, but this guy's the purest evil. The only one that is 100% unjustifiable. "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Why did people tell me nothing big happens for the rest of the season???  I kinda appreciate the lying.  Holy crap.  

PS. Go Sansa!!!!!
"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"One of the best episodes in a very strong season. One scene in particular I have been looking to since the beginning of the season was Jorah's betrayal *finally* revealed. The writers' choice to have Barristan go to Mormont first (""man to man"") showed a lot about both characters, I loved it. The best moment however goes to Oberyn shouting at the Mountain during the duel. ""YOU MURDERED HER, YOU RAPED HER, YOU KILLED HER CHILDREN!"" I'll remember that for a long time."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,The South will remember?
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"There are more than 2 songs in westeros.  Here's one from Dorne in remembrance. 

[The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun,  
and her kisses were warmer than spring.  
But the Dornishman's blade was made of black steel,  
and its kiss was a terrible thing.  
The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed,  
in a voice that was sweet as a peach,  
But the Dornishman's blade had a song of its own,  
and a bite sharp and cold as a leech.  
As he lay on the ground with the darkness around,  
and the taste of his blood on his tongue,  
His brothers knelt by him and prayed him a prayer,  
and he smiled and he laughed and he sung,  
""Brothers, oh brothers, my days here are done,  
the Dornishman's taken my life,  
But what does it matter, for all men must die,  
and I've tasted the Dornishman's wife!""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrJoAy6-or0)"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"i know everyones going on about the oberyn death, which was CRAZY, and Sansa's outfit at the end DAMN GIRL but i thought the exchange between Missandei and Grey Worm was just so sweet and innocent!! I would love to see them get to know each other better and maybe at some point actually kiss. but nothing too raunchy."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Ellaria: You're going to fight that? He's the biggest man I've ever seen.

Oberyn: Size does not matter when you're flat on your back.

Tyrion: Thank the Gods."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,If only he listened to Tyrion and wore a helmet...
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,It's just sad to think that Oberyn's last memory is being humiliated & brutally murdered after being so close to victory. He had his sister's killer on the ground but was [caught monologuing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDzSc6TYJ24). He died because of his pride and arrogance. We all loved Oberyn and he was so close to achieving what he came to King's Landing for.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"""You could have least worn a helmet"" 

:( "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"""It's just an owl you stupid bitch""

Me and my wife have been saying that to each other all week jokingly. "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I think the primary purpose of George R. R. Martin is to take a huge, huge dump on the just-world fallacy and smear the spirit of anyone believing in it with shit.

The soul-crushing anti-climax of such satifying retribution that would have been Oberyn's ran parallel with the profane destruction of the nobility and honor of his quest through the mountains confession as well as the gruesomely grotesque and obscene destruction of his physical beauty. 

At the end, I was in fucking shellshock. I haven't read the books, but I knew it was coming. The fact that it still managed to ruin me is a testament to the quality of the series. But still, GRRM's modus operandi is getting a little old. "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I'm going to attempt to watch it again....going to try...Wish me luck.

If I don't come back, then I've decided that ritual suicide was the only form of release left to me.

EDIT: Survived.  But that ritual suicide is looking pretty good about now..."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"So many people saying they can't ever rewatch the end of this episode... I'm the opposite, I can't stop watching it. It's magnificent.

First I was struck by the sheer brutality, the acting out of what I could only imagine until now. On the second watch I marvelled at the special effects. On the third watch I was drawn to the mountain's dialogue as he admitted his crimes while doing it all over again. The fourth viewing... the screams, oh the screams man. There's something about a man with two metal thumbs in his eyes screaming through a mouth of splintered teeth that just sets my hairs on end.

Long story short: stunningly good."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,[deleted]
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I know a lot of things happened this show, and we're all focused on the fight scene and all the horror of this episode.

But let us not forget all the beauty it brought, namely Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel) in the river. I've been waiting for that since her character was introduced. I don't care if that sounds creepy, Nathalie Emmanuel is an absolutely beautiful woman. "

She had the unfortunate timing to wake up just as Clegaine was gouging Oberyn, saying ""What the hell are you watching?... Oh what the hell?"". I missed Ellaria's scream but not Oberyn's... I sat there in silence for 5mins before I had to watch an episode of 24 after it as I couldn't go to bed straight away. It still haunts me. "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"many manly tears were shed at the end of this episode, im watching this episode during my lunch break and trying not to sob"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I had a History exam this morning so I could't watch this during breakfast...The wait was so worth it because HOLY FUCKING SHIT!! HBO didn't shy away from detail. I loved how Oberyn kept repeatedly shouting for Gregor to confess; he really brought book Oberyn to life I feel. You really felt his hatred for the Mountain and Tywin. His head got fucking pulverised though...That was just as brutal as I imagined it to be! The look on Tyrion's face...

Edit: As others have pointed out, it's the screams and the shattered teeth and such that were really shocking. I've read the books, but even still, I didn't expect it to be so unsettling."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Holy crap... I was getting really tired watching that episode (although it was a good one but its late) and then after the end I was like ""well fuck .. now I need something lighthearted to watch so I can sleep"""
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,It's Tuesday and I'm still reeling.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"The only thing I keep thinking about is the punch that knocked out the Red Viper's teeth.  That's an impressive display of force for being on your back, he probably could have popped his head with a single hook standing up.    Good game Mountain... Good... Game..."

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Here's my question.  I don't really want to go back and watch the scene again, not yet at least.  But do we think the mountain confessed loud enough that others in the audience heard it?  No spoilers, if you can."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Tyrion...will he make the season?
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,I was uncomfortable the whole episode for the pending death of Oberyn
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Oberyn poisoned his spear, right? That means that it would make more sense for Oberyn to poison Joffrey instead of the accused Tyrion."

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"You know, I am still pissed over Oberyn's death. I should of known that he was going to die when he started dancing around and showing off, but I was so sure he was going to win. I thought to myself, how the hell could they kill off *mother fucking Oberyn*. But they sure as hell got me. Every time somthing like this happens I tell myself I wont fall for it the next time but then the next time comes around and I am still caught off card. Man I loved that guy."

That was heart rending. "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,The worse part is how the last words the viper heard before his head went boom boom was how the mountain raped his sister and killed her children. FUCK YOU MAN WHY JUST NOT KILL HIM U ARGHHHHH im so mad I swear to god... ffs fuck this show. 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Did Sexy Prince Man die the same way in the book?

Also, FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCKKKK

I WAS YELLING AT YOU TO GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM HIS HANDS AND YOU STILL GOT MURDERED! GOD FUCKING DAMMIT!"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"As I was watching this episode I kept thinking, scene after scene, that this is the best episode so far. But then the final scene was so disturbing emotionally and visually that I actually feel uncomfortable. I've never been this upset about a gory death in movies/tv before. The combination of disgusting effects and tragic character just put it over the edge for me. I still think this is my favorite episode ever. 

I can appreciate that the producers of the show handled Ned Stark's death with class and good taste. No blood gushing neck stump closeup was needed in that scene. 

I just hope that Oberyn's death results in some kind of major plot development in King's Landing involving Dorne. If Oberyn died *just* for Tyrion's plot line I will be disappointed. Something with the Martells and the Tyrells vs. Lannister or something. Oberyn was too cool and likable to die so horribly and have nothing come of it. 
 "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,this episode was mind blowing 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Is this even a good story anymore? It's just depressing, and has absolutely no appealing plot. I completely understand the 'playing against expectations' that Martin seems to be praised for - but it just seems this show is some kind of strange manifestation of anger that isn't really appealing anymore.

Perhaps the show is popular because it plays into some kind of modern feeling of futility and cynicism against tyranny / power / corruption, but there's virtually 0 counterbalance - and whatever counterbalance there is feels entirely empty - and it's becoming extremely predictable. For example - I could really care less what happens to Tyrion anymore - none of characters seem to have any value to the story, by the writers consistent stylistic preferences.

I'm also finding that the story has virtually 0 philosophical underpinnings. It's so shallow - and has really nothing of consequence to say about anything. Like an elaborate nihilistic thesis, with a lot of ""shocking"" moments to distract the audience into thinking big things are happening.

Perhaps I'm just tired and was kind of annoyed by this last episode haha - but I'm beginning to think that this show & story are actually terrible and I've just been to distracted by shocking fleeting plot devices every now and then, and high production values to notice. (Note: I did have this feeling in season 1 and 2 and 3, but it seems to be more amplified this season.)"

4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,AAAAAAAAAAUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"So for those only following the show, what does this mean for Tyrion? I know Oberyn died, but surely so has the mountain? Tywin sentenced him, but does he not have the argument that, technically, nobody won?"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I feel like it's important to notice the scene after Gilly (probably) survives the Wildlings fucking up Molestown.  Sam is like ""She's totally dead and it's all my fault for leaving her there,"" while the other Night's Watch people are like ""Dude, she survived that rapist and the White Walkers and all this other stuff, she's potentially not dead.""  

There's just these random little tiny bits of hope for no reason.  When that scene happened I was like, ""This is Game of Thrones, why are any of these people hopeful for a happy ending at all.""  Then of course to follow that a guy's head exploded."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Alright I don't read the books or anything... and they're not finished right?
But surely the fact that it's ""ice and fire"" makes it pretty damn obvious that it will ultimately end dragons (fire) vs white walkers (ice)?"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,What we've truly learned from this episode is that confidence is key when fighting a 7 foot 1 mad man.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I was watching this with my GF on Sunday night.  After Oberyn played to the crowd during is intro to the fight, I turned to her and said ""I like that guy.""  I feel like I jinxed him in some way."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,http://i.imgur.com/zBn4OAa.gif
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Random observation: Why is Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, The Unburnt, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, serving as hair stylist to her servant translator?"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I am still shaking. It's been a day since I've seen it, and I am still shaking.

I accidentally stumbled upon gifs on tumblr, so I knew what was coming, but I never figured it would end like that.

I can't see a picture or gif of Ob I just kind of feel sick sort of"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,I love this show like no other but I feel the constant killing of peoples favorite characters is becoming less of GoT characteristic and more of a gimmick. This one time i feel this actually hurt the story. With such an interesting character like Oberyn and the power he would have gotten in a city run by his enemies would have been more interesting then this.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Okay folks, now it's been a few days and our wounds at loosing beloved Oberyn have numbed a bit, can we talk about Dany's move in this episode?

 Alright she was super pissed at Jorah for betraying her, but she basically kicked out a member of her inner circle - Jorah has been one of her closest advisors all along and he knows her plans, her motives and her weaknesses. And after he begged for her love and forgiveness he gets that drop kicked back in the teeth and told to leave and never return.

 Okay you didn't want to kill Jorah, you're BFFs and all, but couldn't you lock him up or something? Instead nope, just gonna kick this scorned dude out with some beefy inside knowledge. That can't possibly backfire on you Dany, nope, of course not. "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,So.. The paper Tywin made Margery's father fetch like a dog a few episodes ago... is what he sent to Daenerys about Jorah. Damn that guy really knows how to play the game!
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"If they kill Tyrion I will completely lose interest. I have a life after this show I don't like to start my week on with these emotions. 

I understand the death, but the way it happened show a exaggerated dark vision of the world."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,[deleted]
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,I hate George RR Martin. Sick Fuck. I bet his favorite characters are cersei and tywin.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"IMO Oberyn's death was by far the most gruesome we've seen yet. Previously, I thought Talisa getting stabbed repeatedly in the womb was the worst but Oberyn's screams as his eyes get pushed in were haunting. And then the crunch of his skull and the sight of his brains all over the ground with his empty eye sockets... (shudder)"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"You know, I was spoiled by a friend about Oberyn's death, yet when I saw how he died this episode, I still yelled ""Oh My God!"" so loudly even the neighbors could hear it, and paired with Oberyn then Ellaria's scream, that might just be the worst death scene I've ever seen in a show."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"It seems like the general book reaction was ""Oh no, Tyrion is going to die now!"", as the Red Viper didn't get nearly as much page time as he seemed to get screen time in the show.

Don't get me wrong, the actor was great, and I loved how we grew attached to him through his excellent abilities, but I wonder how the dynamic of being a ""Show First"" watcher truly stands up to reading the source material first.

TL:DR- which one is actually better, reading or watching first?"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Alright, So I am wondering, if both the big guy and Oberyn died in the end, how is it clear that the gods have decided whether or not Tyrion should die?
My guess is that Tyrion is going to be around for awhile. Btw, I am not a book reader and only a new GOT fan. "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,The lack of music immediately after the end scene where it all turned quiet for a few seconds ... I know they did the same thing after the red wedding...but damn this episode hit me harder than the red wedding.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,This may be a stupid question but what significance is holding the wall? aren't the wildings already south of it? its nothing more then defense for the crows right? its not actually protecting anything.
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I went in thinking that Oberyn was going to die instantly, and started cheering so hard when he started winning. And then...I felt sick after just eating. Why do you do this to me, GoT?"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,This sunday has to be the worse day of my life LA kings won their series and now this what a great way to end the week
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Did anyone feel the budget for this episode was extremely high? The scene in Mulls Town?, Meereen, and of course the final scene looked incredible and reminded me a lot of the cinematography from The last Hobbit movie. "
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"So, did Gregor Clegane die?"
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I've rewatched a lot of scenes over the series but this is one I don't think I will come back to for a long long time.

I knew it was coming but just the sound and the aftermath....

I'm just empty. Not for some hard on over Oberyn and losing another  great character but just for just *how.*

I think I'm done for the night."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"I loved the episode and was hoping that we'd see a bit of Oberyn's revenge come to pass, but the show has become entirely too predictable in killing him off in a ""surprising"" twist. Fresh air would have been letting him/us have an up ending for once. It's bound to come crashing down again anyway, so while GOT is still interesting and entertaining I've learned to distance myself from it emotionally."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,"Was Oberyn's spear poisoned? It seems like they probably just killed The Mountain outright. Oberyn got two good shots in. I thought he only got one to the stomach in the book? I don't think the show is going to waste time having him writhe around in pain, are they? It would seem to make the most sense."
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,Hey guys... hey guys... Ober-indulgent... heh heh heh
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,So... Hate to be the one to ask this... But is the Mountain actually dead? Fuck everything if he isn't. 
4,8,The Mountain and the Viper,So I guess its time to change sigil. AGAIN. Every single house I cheer on dies. Why :D
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"This episode was done in such a way that really made me, at least, appreciate the men of the Night's Watch and their sacrifice towards keeping Westeros safe.  Grenn is such a Badass."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,How amazing was the tracking shot of Castle Black? I was just so in love with that scene!
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Jon killing Styr with a hammer to the head, A+++"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"""I promise you I'm not going to die"" - Me: ""Yup, he's had it.""

I was surprised Sam lived through this episode."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Jon Snow, going into the frozen wilderness alone to assassinate the wildling kingpin is certainly indicative that you know nothing. "

4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"""We should have stayed in the cave...""

*God damn it*."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"That really long shot panning across all the carnage of the battle was one of the best bits of shooting in this entire series. I was blown away by the sheer logistics of pulling off a shot like that (not to mention the rest of this incredible episode). Unbelievably well done.

I'm also super sad about Ygritte. Damn, I liked her."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Not sure if it was him but...THREE-FINGER HOBB WITH A HUGE CLEAVER GET HYPE.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"the scene where Alliser Thorne says ""does fucking nook mean fucking draw, and does fucking hold mean fucking drop"" was the funniest thing this episode. Made me actually like and root for the guy."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,And the coolest death ever award goes to the crow who was jettisoned into oblivion by the giant arrow.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,I love how Ygritte just kept picking up the flaming arrows and shooting them back. I just kept thinking “STOP GIVING HER MORE AMMO!”
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,The cook is a badass!
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,[deleted]
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"The Hollywood big action movies should be taking notes from this episode, because this is how action is supposed to be filmed . Not with shakey cameras and fast cuts , but tightly choreographed action with camera angles that let the audience appreciate what is happening on screen . 

PS: The actor who played Jon Snow did such a good job, he swings the sword like a well trained fighter, who Jon is supposed to be. "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,How many men do you think are left in the watch now? 
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,[deleted]
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Kill of the week: Giant arrow, flying crow

Moment of the week: Olly's 'I got you bro' nod"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Grenn and the men holding the gate and them saying their vows brings me to tears. 
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I love how Jon says *Tormund* at the end. *Tormuund, goddamit, seriously, we're tired*

"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"""Crows before hoes"" -Olly"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I would just like to take moment to say that John Snow rose to the occasion,  he was running shit like a commander"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Despite all the action, my favorite part of the episode was Aemon. That man is a treasure trove of wisdom. "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Even though I'm still on edge wanting to know what is going to happen with our little imp, I was very satisfied with how well that fight scene was played out."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Is Arya still laughing?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"We got one last ""you know nothing."""
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I really wouldnt call myself a romantic, but the line ""we should have stayed in that cave"" I thought was so poetic and hard-hitting.  It gave me love goosebumps."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,[deleted]
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"A lot of love going out to Grenn, but what about poor Pyp?
Watching him grab for Sam to stay with him as he choked through his final breaths really had me going. "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"""HOLD THAT FUCKING GATE!"" "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"There were a ton of really great scenes, with very well thought out cinematography. That long cut showing all the carnage within the walls was fantastic. Also, this episode felt very LoTR, which is not a bad thing.

The episode was good enough to make me forget about episode 8 for a brief while."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Even having read the books and knowing how it ended, Jon's fight with the Magnar still had me on the edge of my seat. The show creators really do an amazing job of keeping up the suspense even for those that have read the book."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Who else liked Sam's sleight of hand quickscope on that Thenn with his XBow? 
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Those panoramic shots were AMAZING, the director really helped the viewers understand how wode the battle was, even though it was in such a confined space. And still managed to focus on major characters within it. The director was the MVP of this episode for me."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"That smile on Jon's face when he sees Ygritte followed by what happened next wrecked me. I had so much testosterone in me from the complete epicness of the episode, then that scene.... I cried like a baby. 
"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,As a powerlifter..The Giant deadlifting the gate was my highlight
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,I wish Grenn was still alive. He was such a courageous and valiant badass! 
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Am I the only one here that is wondering what happened to Ghost after the one scene we see of him killing a wildling? 
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I'm still not very clear on Ser Alliser's condition, can somebody clarify?"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,We need ya boy!
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,I just don't want Sam to die. Sam is fucking awesome.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Can we all just take a moment to appreciate the fact that Styr is dead?  I've been waiting since I first saw him for him to die, preferably at the hands of Jon Snow.  The part where Sam shoots that other dude in the face was excellent as well.  I fucking hate Thenn."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"SO many good scenes this episode. 

Ygritte dying was well done and I felt that stripping the dialogue of the scene down to it's core allowed for the actors to shine through.

I enjoyed the battle immensely, especially since it was in ways, both a seige and a war at the same time. The comedy worked well in the episode and reminded me very much of a Whedon style where comedy is mixed in the emotional scenes, (does nock mean fire, is it over then).

The fight coreography was top notch. You could tell they gave it their all with this one, and the CGI as well as the physical fighting worked great. There was no sense of people pulling blows that you occasionally get and instead we are treated to scenes like the continuous shot in which we see an axe to chest and so on.

The cgi was great and I felt more for the giants than I was expecting to given the circumstances. Also, DAT ANCHOR!

Overall I would give this a 8/10, and would go as far as to say that this is the best battle of the series so far. Maybe blackwater trumps it but its a very close call."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"We are the Watchers on the Wall. Granted your kind might be on the verge of extinction but....bring it bro. 

Too many feels man. Too many. (From both directions).

Edit: Words"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"That had to be the most fighting in a single episode from the series so far, and not a second of it wasn't fantastic. I'd love to have seen what happens to Tyrion for this episode, but damn. This was well done."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I was afraid by the time Sam came back to the battle with Jon that all the nights watch would be dead the way the wildlings were cutting through them! Great episode though, I think it's definitely one of my favorites. Shout out to my homeboy Grenn for holding that gate."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,After a second viewing I got the double meaning behind Ygritte's conversation with Thenns.  During the first viewing I thought she was talking about cunnilingus not literally [this guy](http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/971a1bb9c81223e832a48d2dec469f45/0x600.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000) eating her ginger minge.  
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I've sat through 3 1/2 seasons of this show. I've run a gamut of varying emotions. Last week's episode really disturbed me, but this week's episode...fuck. 

I finished it like fifteen minutes ago and the god damned tears just keep coming. God damn you, Game of Thrones. You've finally broken me. "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Awesome performances by Jon, Tormund, Aemon, Sam, Ser Alliser, etc. And the feels in the tunnel scene and the aftermath.

I thought this episode was incredible. Definitely the best this season, maybe my favorite overall. 
"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"This episode reminded me why this is the best show on television. We pretty much get a 50+ minute movie every week. It's incredible the amount of production that goes into these episodes. And this was the best looking episode yet. Everything looked amazing. The cinematography, the choreography, the CGI. The people who make this show deserve every award there is."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Now I don't want anybody sitting on the Iron Throne except Sam.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"So if there are 100 000 wildlings why just send like 50 over the wall? Tormund's company seemed to have a bit more success than those trying to climb just below Castle Black. Only the giants seemed to do any damage to the defenders..

AND why the fuck would the wildlings even try to siege through Castle black? Wouldn't it be better to try in any other place? Or is it the lift they want?"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,[removed]
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I thought it was really interesting how Sam, who had more to lose, refused to abandon his brothers while Janos Slynt, who's supposed to be a brave leader, hid. Really showed who the actual coward is."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"""Does nock fucking mean draw?"""
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Was anybody else expecting the third horn every time the two for wildlings went off?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"The cinematography in this episode was stunning. That long shot was amazing and must have taken forever to choreograph correctly. This episode had everyone I was watching with cheering as if watching a sporting event, and it showed viewers that this particular story line is more important than we may have thought it before. Overall, I loved the episode and I am pretty relieved that there weren't any really huge deaths, i.e., Jon or Sam, although I am sad to hear that Pyp and Grenn didn't die in the books. And now it's time to see what happens at King's Landing."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Why do they keep Ghost locked up all the time? It's not like he's an insane beast who eats anyone he sees. Why isn't he always by Jon's side?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"All i could think of when this ""I fucked a bear story"" started was : Robert Baratheon would have loved to hear that. "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"What was the point of the wildlings with the giants, only about 20 climbed the wall. The rest just stood there and left?"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"One of the most devastating bits for me was when [Pyp](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Pypar) died.

He kills a wildling and he's so happy because of how scared he was before this all started. Sam jokes with him & tells him to carry on. He's got one, Sam jokes with him & he feels like he's getting into the swing of things. Then from nowhere, the arrow. 

Sad, brutal moment which wiped the smile off my face."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"My thoughts: ""Holy shitballs, is that a giant riding a fucking mammoth?!?""  

10 minutes later, Jon Snow: ""They've got giants riding fucking mammoths!""

"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,So many great things in this episode. Even the music was incredible.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Pyp KDR 1-1
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"You can watch a thousand battle scenes and after all is said and done, they're pretty much the same. Men and women (mostly men), wielding arrows and swords, slashing throats and smashing inanimate objects in to each other's sculls.

For me, GoT really shines through its dialogue. No doubt that the cinematography in this episode was brilliant however it was the portrayal of human emotion that resonated for me. 

“We could spend all night trading tales of lost loves. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death”- pure poetry.

"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"So they better get to sealing the tunnel now... Would be strange if they didn't.

Also, why didn't the wildlings just climb the wall between for instance Castle Black and Eastwatch by the Sea? They could just climb on top of it and then flank the crows at Castle Black..."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I cried when Ygritte died...

I knew it was coming but I still cried. Too bad we won't get to see Leslie on the set anymore."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,This was honestly one of my favorite episodes of all time... simply because Snow is one of my favorite characters and it didn't skip from character to character every five minutes. 
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I hope the Night's Watch will be able to get the giant's corpse and send it's enormous pieces across Westeros as a way of saying ""HOLY SHIT DUDES, WE'RE FACING FUCKING GIANTS AND WE NEED REINFORCEMENTS ASAP."""
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Noooo Pyp!
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Is it just me or were there a lot of Jon Snow look-a-likes in the battle at Castle Black?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Is this the only episode that the entire episode is focused in a single story line (Jon Snow)? actually the entire episode is focused at a single location too (castle black)
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"This was the most tear-jerkyish episode for me thus far.
I can't handle seeing strong men get their heart broken. Ugh.
"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I thought they were gonna dump all the dead over the wall, wait for them to turn into White Walkers. Since I assume White Walkers can't climb that shit, they'd turn around and go ape on the Wildling army."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"By the way; if they had flooded the gate, Jon wouldn't be able to go out killing Mance. 

More points to Alliser Thorne."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,">I got one! Right through the heart; he's dead.

> Oh. S'it over?"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,I can deal with all the deaths but why pyp? whyyyyyy?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I started to like Thorne after this episode, I kinda hope he's not dead"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Is it just me or did this last episode contain some of the most bad ass stuff from the whole season so far. Like a fucking giant riding a fucking mammoth? Or the scythe? It was pretty fucking awesome.
"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Hold up, I just want to acknowledge something. Ygritte killed Olly's dad, and styr killed Olly's mom. Now Olly killed Ygritte who was about to kill Jon snow who had already just killed Styr. Good for you Olly!"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Why can't they seal the wall *now*? Does it take days and days? 
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Wait, if Ygritte wasn't shot, would she shoot Jon?"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I saw in the Episode Premiere Discussion that people were wondering how many members of the Night's Watch were left after the battle. I rewatched the episode and counted **34 apparent, on screen deaths.** And in episode 4.8, Jon and crew said that there were 102 men of the Watch at Castle Black. That means that, at most, there are now **68 men left.** 

Of course, not all of the deaths were captured on screen so I think it's safe to say that their numbers are now well under 50."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Was anyone else at the edge of their seat when Sam was talking to the other guy(I can't think of his name atm) in the hallway when he was talking about being afraid and stuff? They kept panning towards Sam and I was so scared you were just gonna see an arrow fly straight into his head... Then they showed Ygritte too... I was so scared Sam was gonna die. ;-;
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I don't know why people are upset about Ygritte dying. I get that she and Jon were in love, but I don't get why! We spent the whole season watching her and the Wildlings kill tons of innocent people all over the place, and then last night spend an hour watching her kill Jon's brothers. She was a bad person and it was time for her to go."

4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Anyone else feel like Ygritte is a little naive when discussing the wall?

She gets all pissed off saying ""they came here, put up a big wall and said this was their land. This is our land etc...""

Bitch that happened 8000 years ago. Everyone you're attacking has been living there for literally hundreds of generations, it's pretty silly to act like they're still foreigners who stole your land."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Was watching it high. 420/10
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,I think this was the only episode in the series that focused on one event the entire episode.  I liked it.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"This episode was kind of underwhelming for me. The production value was awesome, and there were certain scenes that stood out to me, but something seemed off to me. Maybe it was the pacing? I almost feel as though this episode should have been episode 8, and the Mountain vs the Viper should have been episode 9. "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Was anyone else really underwhelmed by Ygritte's death scene? Felt like it was dripping with more cheese than a bowl of soggy easy mac
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"last week someone posted a meme about seeing some big fucking giants because there haven't been many dragon scenes this season. I couldn't find it again but whoever posted that, kudos for being spot on."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Did anyone do a running tally of how many of the 102 nights watch members died tonight?  Off the top of my head, Ygritte, Styr and Tormund probably had at least 20 kills combined.  The giants I think had 7 kills.  A few fell off the wall as well."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Surprisingly enough, this went better than I anticipated. What they say is true. If you expect every single person to die, you'll be pleasantly surprised. (Not saying that I didn't cry (but less than George R.R Martin has conditioned me to expect))"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Did anyone else notice that after the battle when Jon is talking to Sam, he says ['*fighting*' (link)](http://youtu.be/Cq8jMEkZwik?t=1m17s) with Ygritte's accent? It's a small thing and I don't know if it was intentional, but it struck me almost more than when she died."

4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,So does the Horn of Winter not exist in the show? I mean there's still a lot to show with only one more episode.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Why the fuck did he think that the best plan was to go out alone after the first attack? 

It's impossible to feed 100 000 men for a prolonged time. Especially since everything is frozen and the forest behind them is fucking burning. Hold out a couple of days and they will all starve to death. Seems like George RR Martin doesn't know how sieges work. "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I used to be a badass berserker, but then I took an arrow to the knee - Tormund"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I may be the only one, but I was a little let down by the Episode. Soooooo much happened in the book and it was spread out over more than one day. I loved how the wall ""Defended"" itself in the book. I also felt like one of the main points of the book was the gate in the wall was the only thing that mattered and how Jon focused all there forces on defending it. Aside from sending Grenn to defend the gate, little else was done to highlight this point. "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,...and I thought I hated Joss Whedon for killing my favorite characters...
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Anyone else catch how John Snow spits in Styr's eye just like Karl Tanner does to him while taunting him about fighting with honor?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I don't really understand all this Ygritte hate. Treating her like some savage wilding who killed without purpose. She was a soldier of Mance Raider and a soldier for her people who have be wrongfully forced beyond the wall. She didn't kill for pleasure she killed for duty, until her love for Jon snow stripped her of that. She was a great character and the first girl Jon ever loved. She deserves no hate."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,this was a bit better than the Battle of Blackwater :) 
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"when jon sees ygritte for the first time during the battle, his smile melted my heart"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"So is it just me, or was anyone else kind of glad that Ygritte died?

I mean, when you put it in perspective, she and her comrades were some scummy cunts. Even in the GoT universe."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,That bro nod.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"When Sam shot that bald guy in the face I yelled out ""quickscope"""
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I don't see why people are so curious about Tyron that some have said they didn't appreciate this episode as much because it was 100% castle black. To me, this was the best episode of thrones that I have ever seen.

The buildup to the battle was done expertly in my opinion. They made you really connect with the brothers on then wall and feel the bond that they share. When they sounded those horns, I was shitting my pants in fear for them. I really felt like I was there with them, about to face 100,000 wildlings.

Everyone made sacrifices (minus that shitbag Janos Slynt). The scene at the inner gate gave me chills. Giantsbane was a complete badass for the whole episode and thank god Styr got his. I also loved seeing how dangerous Ser Alliser can be and obviously John snuuuuuu kicked major ass the whole episode.

I don't know about you guys but I was emotionally spent after that episode, which to me is the sign of a masterpiece.

Edit: grammars


Also, I smoked a huge blunt with my friends before soooo maybe that had something to do with it. But still, to me, best episode of thrones to date."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,[removed]
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Mission impossible 2.0 Jon snow edition really guys that's the ending we get?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Did I see Styr lick his lips when he saw Sam?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,After reading for a while the comments I guess I was the only one who wanted Ygritte to die and was yelling at Jon Snow for standing there with her while the fight continued.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Command of the wall changed hands more than a blunt at a Snood Dogg concert
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I think GoT is at its least interesting when it tries to be Braveheart or Gladiator.  This week's episode reinforced this belief.  It was a good episode, but ultimately it signified nothing.  As we hear at the end, the Wildlings are just going to attack again anyway.  The only thing this episode accomplished was clearing out some deadwood from the Night's Watch cast.

GoT's strength is character and dialogue.  I'll take a Littlefinger monologue or a Tyrion/Cersei verbal sparring match over a battle any day.

Not a bad episode.  Definitely better than almost anything else on TV.  But it wasn't the show at its best.  "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Wow the feels in that episode 
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,[deleted]
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Slynt was acting like such a god damned pussy, I said during the show ""knowing GRRM, that bastard will escape the whole thing unscathed""... and what do you know."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"That episode was balls to the Wall awesome from start to finish. 

I can't wait to see Slynt get whatever's coming to him. 

...he does get something, right? Right?! "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,I thought the most interesting difference from the book was the way Ygritte died. Certainly the series' method was more dramatic where she essentially dies because of her love of Jon. The book is much more ambiguous with Ygritte found by Jon who wonders whether his arrow killed his love.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"OLLY'S GONNA FUCKING DIE. I HAVEN'T READ THE BOOKS, BUT I CAN JUST FEEL IT. This is what Game of Thrones has come to, endearment followed by death."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,[removed]
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,The highlight for me was the flaming arrows flying through the air. So badass.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall," I was happily surprised that Lord Giantsdontexistpoopycowardwimp didn't end up killing/raping Gilly in that room, since he seemed so shocked and could have been like, ""well, I'm going to die and their is this woman who miraculously appeared, I might as well go out fucking!"" I was so sure something bad would happen because of that would generally be the only reason of showing him entering the room at all- mind fuck (or like the mind fuck of the last episode- teehee)
Also, I wouldn't have minded if Gilly had killed Lord Poopy with the pot she was holding- it would have felt satisfying.

Jon became even more of an action hero this episode! 
Glenn doh. Glenn is a badass. Was a badass.. :( 
Edit: Lord not Sir"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"For whatever reason, Ygritte's death got me more than any other on the show. Maybe because it was sad rather than shocking. "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I'm a little confused why they only sent 5 people to the tunnel. If it is imperative to the defense, couldn't they have spared a few more people from the top of the wall?  "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Awesome
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Does anyone know why the episodes are becoming so short?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,[Did Jon Snow really front roll out of the elevator?](http://gfycat.com/YellowDopeyBluefish)

4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Do yall think Yigrette let Gilly and her babe live because it was a mother and her newborn, or because she recognized her as a wildling?"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,YOU KNOW NOTHING JON SNOW
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,did anyone see Hob for.he just walks up with a BIG FUCKING BUTCHERS KNIFE and kills a wildling. complete badass
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,I wonder what Randyll Tarly would think if he saw his son now.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"As much fun as the scythe was to watch, once the fridge logic kicks in you realize that it's really only useable once, and only at a specific time (as if the Wildlings were too high or too low, it'd miss them). Heck, if they'd climbed single file instead of all in a row it wouldn't have been nearly as effective."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Look to the east 
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"did anyone else notice at the end when Jon shot Tormund with the crossbow, where he shot him? I used to be Tormund giants bane then I took an arrow to the knee"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Does anyone else feel like the Free People's army had a horrible battle strategy?

They send a group over the wall so that they can attack from both sides. That was good, but...

On the other side of the wall, they first have their entire army just stand there yelling, BEGGING to be mowed down by fire arrows. Then they have two giants and a single wooly mammoth plus a bunch of men slowly trudge their way toward the wall. Did they think that the crows wouldn't have anti-seige weapons such as oil, fire, and something to keep climbers off the wall? They have a few men scale the wall only to be killed off by arrows and that giant scythe thing. Meanwhile, the giants and mammoth are stopped by oil bombs. 

So, in summary, their tactic on one side was good but depended on relief from the other side, which suffered from an utter lack of planning and efficient use of resources. Plus, they were told by John that they would be facing a shit ton of men, so why send such a small group to the other side of the wall while providing almost zero chances of relief?"
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Did anyone else think of Skyrim when they saw the giant riding a mammoth?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,TBH all this fighting is not very interesting for me. its what the show advertises. but this episode and the one in season 2. with only fighting is just boring to me.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Props to the night-watchers who holded the gate till reinforcement arrived.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,The wildlings would of easily won if the giants used the arrows on all the defences before rushing to the gate.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,what happend to the giant in the tunnel?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Is Sir Allesor dead?
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I spent the entire episode sitting so close to my screen! Such a tense, action packed episode. Sam really stepped up, I'm so proud! The other Nights Watch commander guy (I think it's Janos Slynt?) is such a douche. He deserved to die, not Pyp. Or Grenn. :("
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"Holy shit!

I thought I would be bored by a whole episode on the wall, but I FUCKING LOVED IT!  That was the best episode of the season, and possibly the entire series!  I LOVED IT!  So fucking badass!  Everyone was really doing their duty and just killing it! (Except Janos Slynt, fuck him the freaking coward)

But Ygritte noooooo :(

and Pyp...and Grenn!  Jon really only has Sam now."
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,"I'm sorry, worst siege preparations ever. They should have been raining down fiery death nonstop. I realize we're supposed to think the Night's Watch is badly led, but they could have had decades old oil and centuries old siege engines. Hell, they did have a scythe and a single balustra apparently. 

Boiling oil or molten iron would play havoc with climbing a sheer ice wall. Just saying. "
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Only game of thrones episode i actually disliked. First i liked it but then it just started dragging on. It was like watching a long action movie fight with Jon Snore.
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,[deleted]
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Did Ygrette's body get burned? If not is it possible for her to come back as a Walker? Seems Jon Snow may very well be Lord Commander one day. Is it possible Jon Snow may suffer the same fate as The Night's King? I understand the Night's Watch vows were intended to prevent another incident like the Night King's but we have already seen Jon break his vows for Ygrette. Does the disposal of her body get talked about at all in the books? 
4,9,The Watchers on the Wall,Well that very well may have been the most disappointing episode in this entire series. I'm going to to sleep now and forget that I actually made it through that entire pile of garbage they tried to pass off as an episode.

4,10,The Children,I could never make my mind up while reading or watching if The Hound actually gave a shit about Arya or if he was just keeping her around to make a bit of money. Even saving her life at The Twins you could argue he only did so he could try and sell her to Lysa but this episode finally cleared that up!

4,10,The Children,I was utterly disappointed at the lack of pain the Mountain was in.
4,10,The Children,STANNIS OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE!!
4,10,The Children,"I still think my favorite part of the episode was Bloodraven trolling Bran.

""You're going to help me walk again!?""
""lolno"""
4,10,The Children,"Brienne ""Mike Tyson"" of Tarth"
4,10,The Children,"And Gendry is still out there, rowing. For another year.

4,10,The Children,How long will the Lannisters be able to hold King's Landing without Tywin or Tyrion?
4,10,The Children,"""My lion.""

Me: HOW DARE YOU CALL HIM THAT. THAT NAME WAS FOR TYRION."
4,10,The Children,"Did anyone else expect a much grander fall by the hound, and then laughed when he was only tumbling down the mountain side? Silly drunk hound. "
4,10,The Children,"I was really impressed with this episode's connection to the title. Of course it alluded to The Children of the Forest FINALLY making their appearance, but nearly every situation presented dealt with being a child in some way.
- Jon snow answers Stannis' questions based on being Ned's child.
- The Children save Bran and co (who are children, and Hodor is essentially a child as well)
- Brienne and Sandor brawl over who is the right parent for the displaced child, Arya
- Tyrion kills his father, discusses how life has been as his child
- Daeny is forced to discipline her children due to the death of a child

Well done, writing staff!"
4,10,The Children,"Qyburn, on The Mountain: I can save him, but the process will change him somewhat. 

Cersei: Will it weaken him?

Qyburn: No...but he will be recast with another actor again. New season - new Mountain. "
4,10,The Children,They could have done with a scene earlier in the season where The Children were mentioned in an 'Old Nan' type story by Bran or Jojen just to give a brief overview and how they're a mythical race etc. Would have made the reveal a bit less confusing.
4,10,The Children,"So does anyone wonder if what Tywin said was true, that he wasn't going to actually execute Tryion? Or was that just a ploy to get him to drop his guard so that he might have had a chance to kill him.

And also why The Hound!? I liked him way more than Brienne! Also wasn't expecting Arya to be so cold to him! Thought she had grown to like him a bit"
4,10,The Children,"This may be a slightly silly question, but what exactly is the custom behind saying, ""Valar Dohaeris"" in response to ""Valar Morghulis""? Is it just small talk or is there a greater meaning behind it (ie. only used by non-Faceless Men or something)? I'm asking this as a show watcher only, and I don't believe it's really been explained."
4,10,The Children,Wait. Where the hell is rickon?!
4,10,The Children,Tyrion always double-taps. 
4,10,The Children,"This is the first finale that really felt like a FINALE. Pretty much every scene kicked ass, despite the changes from the books. All the main actors brought their A game, especially Maisie Williams, Rory McCann, Peter Dinklage, and Charles Dance. Every character is in a new place, literal or otherwise, and I can't wait for season 5.

And now the wait begins."
4,10,The Children,Happy Father's Day!
4,10,The Children,The best season so far IMO. Looking forward to the traveling adventures of Tyrion and Varys.
4,10,The Children,"I'm really struggling with both Dany and Bran's storylines. But as a show-only watcher, I'm assuming that means theirs are the most central to the plot in the last seasons.

I'm really excited for Jon + Stannis/Mell (and Davos) and where the story could head next with them. Stannis showing up was a total curveball for me. I audibly said ""WHAT THE FUCK"" when they showed Stannis pimping up to Snow and Raydar.

Did anyone see Alliser at the burning ceremony?

Edit: 

I kind of wanted a White Walker to come and reanimate Ygritte. Nothin' like frozen ginger minge."
4,10,The Children,"Who else became a full-blown Stannis supporter?

All those who reply in the negative must bend the knee or be destroyed."

4,10,The Children,Another brilliant finale.
4,10,The Children,"I LOVED how it ended with Ayra sailing off into the big bad world. She's my favourite characters in the books and her best bits are just starting. Maisie Williams is perfect when she does her badass routine, I'm glad they showed her walking away from The Hound in spite and they didn't have some soppy made up farewell scene between the two of them.

However, the Tyrion and Tywin scene though just didn't do it justice in my opinion. I guess you needed the whole [ASOS](#b ""Tysha"") background to get the full extent of Tyrion's hatred and I felt that fobbing it off as him being mad over mega-whore Shae diminished it somewhat.
"
4,10,The Children,"The ending with Arya struck such a powerful emotional chord. I'm not sure anything that's come before matched that for me, and I'd already had her destination spoiled for me. The show has hardly been about evoking merely simple emotions, but I think the depth of feeling is really going somewhere special...I can't imagine how bittersweet the end of the series will be."
4,10,The Children,Never forget #HOUND
4,10,The Children,I think Ser Pounce will be the next hand of the king
4,10,The Children,Why didn't Ayra kill The Hound when he asked?
4,10,The Children,I'm kind of bothered by Shae's character. Why would she sleep with Tywin? Why would Tywin sleep with her? 
4,10,The Children,"Now that I'm over [ASOS](#b ""the lack of LSH""), I can safely look back at this episode and say that everything was perfect except for Tyrion's escape."
4,10,The Children,"SUNDAY! SUNDAY! SUNDAY!: THE PINCER IN THE WINTER! THE MANNIS WITH THE PLANNIS! THE KING WITH THE MOREST BRINGS THE PAIN IN THE FOREST!
"
4,10,The Children,"I don't understand, and I don't know if this was explained in the books because it's been so long since I read them, so bear with me.

North of the Wall, the White Walkers are coming back. This much we know. All dead bodies are being burned to prevent adding to their numbers, yes?

So, what are the re-animated skeletons that attack Bran and company all about? For one thing, if bones can be reanimated, does it really matter if they're charred or not? Bones is bones. For another thing, do we know these are definitely White Walkers? It's the most obvious explanation and assumption, and I can't see a reason for there being a different TYPE of reanimated corpse, BUT, they were being defeated by Meera, who was not using Dragonglass weapons (unless I missed something somewhere, and the skeletons were equipped with Dragonglass, as she ended up using one skeleton's axe against several others).

Are these ""lesser"" wights, then?!"
4,10,The Children,I was hoping Sansa and Baelish would be in this finale!
4,10,The Children,"I think this is the season finale I've enjoyed the most BUT, anyone else thinks Jojen's death looked cheap as fuck? I mean the whole stabbing while on the ground scene. I had a little moment of cringe with that one. Otherwise, GREAT season finale."
4,10,The Children,Brianne of Tyson... 
4,10,The Children,I hope season 5 opens with spreading news of Tywin's death and Cersei's reaction.
4,10,The Children,"Great end to a great season. As a show watcher only, I really enjoyed it and can't wait for next season."
4,10,The Children,"The series is killing people it *doesn't* need to kill, goddammit!"

4,10,The Children,I see there are very different opinions about the finale but there is one thing I think we can all agree on. The music was executed perfectly :)
4,10,The Children,That Child of the Forest totally throws like a girl
4,10,The Children,Please tell me I'm not the only one a little distraught over Tywin's death? He was actually my favorite.
4,10,The Children,KILL ME! 
4,10,The Children,"I was content that I got to closure and see Ygritte one last time, and yet saddened to know that she is *really* dead. As a show watcher and just starting to read the books, I really enjoyed this season. "

4,10,The Children,"[ASOS](#b ""Still sad about the no LSH"")"
4,10,The Children,"Total What The Fuck episode for me.

Let's see...

* Daenerys with some serious dragon cruelty. I was rooting for her, but now I just can't. Emilia Clarke will make that hard however.

* Stannis out of fuckin' nowhere.

* Bran and the Crippled Psychic Kiddies Adventure Squad (credit that to /u/Daveaham_Lincoln) finally get to the fucking magic tree and fucking Pirates of the Caribbean skeletons pop out of the ground. It doesn't even stop there. Some little girl lobs crazy ass grenades at the skeletons to save the Squad. What the fuck. It doesn't even stop there. They then went inside the magic tree to meet some creepy wizard guy who is either Gandalf's cousin or God. I don't even.

* Arya is going to Bravos to be a bank teller I guess.

* Tyrion survived. He killed everyone who needed to be killed excerpt for Cersei. There's no question in my mind that he is the main protagonist, and he will win the Game of Thrones. It's Game of Thrones though, so I'm obviously wrong."
4,10,The Children,There's a very specific scene that happens in the books but hasn't happened in the show that I really want to see. That scene in question is Mance Rayder telling Jon Snow the reason why he decided to break his vows and stay beyond the Wall. Luckily it's still possible for this conversation to take place. Although it is a little disheartening as it was supposed to take place not long after Jon meets him.
4,10,The Children,"I've been giving a lot of thought over this finale and I've realized that the most disappointing thing for me was the way Jaime was portrayed. [ASOS](#b ""Explicitly turning down Cersei in the White Sword Tower is a huge moment for his character. He flat out refuses to break his vows there and it shows that he's turning away from Cersei and towards being a true knight. Thrown on top of this was the absolute gutting of his goodbye with Tyrion. They've completely removed the spark that lights the fire of his rebirth and he finishes this episode loving Cersei again and with no indication that anything that went on with Brienne or Oathkeeper is sticking."")

I've always been one to defend D&D and the changes they've made. I understand that, as an adaptation, the show needs to change and simplify plots. But this is the first time I've felt like one of those book readers who just completely can't understand why they're making the decisions they're making. After this episode, my take-away is that I no longer trust them to *adapt* the books for television so much as I expect them to *re-write* the books. I don't know, I guess we'll see where season 5 goes."
4,10,The Children,"As a show-watcher, I was spoiled and told about [ASOS / Season 5 Spoiler](#b ""Catelyn as Lady Stoneheart""). After being disappointed with the spoiling, I actually began to look forward to it and consequently set myself up for it. When [ASOS](#b ""it didn't happen""), I felt what most of the book readers must be feeling. It's now strange and pretty anticlimactic to have to wait for Season 5 to see whether it plays out. 

Edit: Tags"
4,10,The Children,I hate Bran's storyline so much that i was happy about Jojen's death.
4,10,The Children,"I hated how Bloodraven and Leaf looked.

Leaf just looked like a uncanny valley little girl and NOT supposed to lob grenades at skeletons. 

and Bloodraven looks stupid. He's supposed to have one red eye, pale skin, and a red birthmark on his face and completely taken by the tree. He's not supposed to look like Dumbledore sitting on some roots, he's supposed to be fucking old (like waaaay beyond natural - like more than decrepit) and super creepy and mysterious. Plus him having both eyes makes the ""thousand eyes and one"" quote to be fucking meaningless. Its a play on word on how Bloodraven has a huge reach yet only has one eye. To make sense it would be ""a thousand eyes and two"" which just sounds dumb

I know people are more pissed about one certain someone but this was some serious bullshit. "
4,10,The Children,[removed]
4,10,The Children,"People seem to be very upset about the things that happened, the things that didn't happen, the things that should have happened.  For me, it was a great season of television and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  

Was it perfect, no, not at all, there were scenes throughout the 10 hours that made me scratch my head and wonder why they would do this or that.  What is perfect though?  Even the books aren't perfect.

Winter is coming my friends, and with it the memories of some epic moments this season had to offer, and when the sun rises in April, season 5 will stand!!"
4,10,The Children,[The Hound vs. Brienne](http://youtu.be/sIgl-G9HMQU) 
4,10,The Children,"A little late to the party, but here are my thoughts on the episode. First things first: The whole episode felt a little bit ""off"" in comparison to the rest of the series, but I liked it really, really much. The pacing was very good and I liked that it had that kind of ""epic"" feeling to it.

What I didn't like: Of course, THE missing scene. I would have loved to see that and it would have given the whole story such an amazing twist. Also Leaf throwing these World of Warcraft fireballs around, that was a little goofy. The three eyed raven didn't look creepy enough for my taste, but that's just me. I always imagined him with roots growing through his face and stuff, almost becoming a tree himself. Tyrions climax was a little underwhelming, it was handled too fast and hadn't I read the books I wouldn't be too sure on his motivations to kill Shae and Tywin. In the books it just felt so good and just to kill Tywin, because he's giving Tyrion so many reasons to do so, but in the series Tyrion suddenly looks like a maniac on a killing spree, which didn't fit with his series-persona at all, in my opinion. I get that they had to let Shae grab the knife to hate her even more and give Tyrion a reason to kill and that they tried to turn the whole [ASOS](#b ""Tysha-story"") on Shae, but I think it didn't nearly work as good as the original story.

Anyways - what I liked: Brienne vs. The Hound. Honestly, that was something I would have loved in the books. Finally some characters get to meet each other. The fight felt amazingly brutal and was so much fun to watch, probably my new favourite fight in GoT. I'm also not that angry that Jaime and Tyrion say farewell in good terms - I'm good with a little glimpse of hope now and then in comparison to the books, where everything just goes downhill all the way. And even if I didn't like Leafs goofy fireballs, I thought the skeletons looked REALLY good and the whole scene worked pretty well. 

All in all I thought it might be one of the five best episodes, even with the changes done to the book-story. "
4,10,The Children,"As much of a scumbag as he was, it pained me to see Tywin go. So ends the tale of one of the smartest and most devious men in westeros."
4,10,The Children,"I think that Bran is going to be the one riding the dragon Drogon that he sees in his visions. Drogon has been missing for 3 days since the last anyone has seen of him. Also, The 3-Eyed Raven guy says ""He died so you could find what you have lost"" Bran ""You're going to help me walk again?"" 3ER ""You will never walk again. But you will fly""

I could be wrong but that's my own theory. It makes sense now that season 4 has ended."
4,10,The Children,"So I've just watched the episode and... wait, why is the post posted 7 minutes ago as of now? Didn't it air like yesterday? I FEEL CONFUSED.
I don't think it was as awesome as the writers have hyped us, but it was very good.
Edit: oh, yeah, there's a premiere discussion somewhere else."
4,10,The Children,"I want to like Brans story but the magic fireballs, children, jojens horrible acting death and tree man made me hate it even more :("
4,10,The Children,"As much as I wanted the Arya - Sansa meetup to happen, I'm really happy for Arya. I think that this is the best thing for her."
4,10,The Children,Happy fathers day
4,10,The Children,Makes me sad knowing it's over!
4,10,The Children,How does freeing tyrion benefit varys? Why do it?
4,10,The Children,"I'm not even slightly upset at Jojen's death. It's a shame because he could have actually had some character development, not just a coach for Bran so he sort of knew what was happening."
4,10,The Children,"Well I really enjoyed it but after reading the differences in Tyrions revenge from the 'Adding context..' post, I'm disappointed that that backstory/reveal wasn't used. Mostly because I don't understand *why* it wasn't used. Time constraints is the only thing I can think of, but it doesn't seem like that would have been a big deal. Shame, it would have really enhanced the moment.

Apart from that, awesome GoT fun."
4,10,The Children,So... Tyrion and Tywin are eskimo buddies? 
4,10,The Children,First I wanted Arya to go with Brienne and learn to be a badass woman fighter. Then I really wanted her to go hang with Jon at the Wall. Now I'm beyond satisfied with her stubbornness.
4,10,The Children,So Alliser was pulled away from the battle in e09 wounded. He wasn't showed in this episode and it would make sense that he would be shown during the burning. Where he at? He dead? Is Aemon looking after him?
4,10,The Children,How did Stannis get to the Wall? Is it not really far away from wherever he was?
4,10,The Children,"So am I the only one that thought the stare down between Jon Snow and Melisandre was massive foreshadowing?
Out of everything that happened in the episode, that scene got to me the most."
4,10,The Children,"I came up with a theory just before watching 4.10 that all the characters who die in this story are the ones who don't know how to play the ""game"" of thrones - that is, they don't know that the only acceptable motive in the world of GRRM is power. Ned played for honor, Catelyn played for family, Robb played for love, Oberyn played for vengeance, Joffrey played for vanity. They all died. Littlefinger, Varys, Tyrion, Tywin, Stannis, Cersei all play for power, and are (or were) safe. Sansa is now playing for power and should be safe. I think Tywin died because he let his hatred of Tyrion interfere with his otherwise purely power-oriented motives. [vague speculation](#g ""Tyrion is now in even more danger than before because he has started playing for vengeance. I think Arya, Jon and Dany are safe because they're too important to their individual story lines. Cersei is in serious danger because she's playing for family now even more than before."")"
4,10,The Children,Seems like danerys doesn't really care about returning to westeros and is content on being queen of slavers bay.
4,10,The Children,And now we wait nine months for more shows. :(
4,10,The Children,"Sorry but what the fuck is going on with the plotholes here?

Arya and the Hound at the Bloody Gate: Why would they be allowed to leave? Littlefinger would have been told of their arrival and he sure as hell would have tried to keep her.

The wights that kill Jojen: Why doesn't Summer smell them? We've seen the direwolves flip out in the past when danger was near, so why did he casually ignore this?

Dragon chains: Those chains are smaller than the heads of the dragons - they would easily fall off."
4,10,The Children,"""People die squatting over their chamber pots.""

Epic foreshadowing."
4,10,The Children,I'm still salty about how they whitewashed Tyrions story.
4,10,The Children,"""Is Tyrion Lannister gonna have to choke a bitch"" is all i could think of when we saw  that WHORE."
4,10,The Children,[deleted]
4,10,The Children,Actually loved the scene between Cersei and Tywin. Pretty tired of her strumming around like she has any purpose or power.
4,10,The Children,"What would Brienne do with Arya if she had taken her?

Edit: And is there another reason she would be so opposed to the Hound watching over her (besides his reputation perhaps)?"
4,10,The Children,Valar Morghulis!
4,10,The Children,"Until now I've held out on reading the books mostly to spite my book-reader friends who tell me that I HAVE to read the books.  Don't think I can hold out anymore, I need to know what happens..."
4,10,The Children,could Bronn have betrayed Tyrion by turning Shae over to Tywin? he seemed super dodgy about taking her to the boat...
4,10,The Children,[deleted]
4,10,The Children,"[ASOS](#b ""In the end, Tywin Lannister did not, in fact, shit gold."")"
4,10,The Children,"Ok, so can I get a run down of what happened with Bran? Is that guy like 4000 years old and part raven? Can he go in dreams? Is that little girls also like 4000 years old? What were those fireball things? Why were skeletons reanimating? I'm sorry, but that scene was the biggest of the episode in my opinion."
4,10,The Children,"So did the Hound admit that he was protecting Arya now and trying to keep her safe instead of holding her hostage? Given the confrontation between him and Brienne I can understand his reasons for attacking her, I get the feeling Brienne was less fussed about Arya herself and more fussed about keeping her Oath even though she would have been taking Arya where it was pretty clear Catelyn didn't want her. "
4,10,The Children,Gosh darn it all. I just can't seem to make it into an episode. I'm so lonely. Kevan ignores me and Cersei hits me. :(
4,10,The Children,So Stannis sailed around the wall and then rode his troops through the snow along the wall? Good thing there was no sudden snow storm.
4,10,The Children,"Peter Dinklage should be nominated for the Emmy for his work on this season, especially the last episode. "
4,10,The Children,"Get rekt, Mance."
4,10,The Children,I don't know what the rest of the book readers are talking about. This episode was awesome. 
4,10,The Children,"Burn me at the stake if you want, but Tywin Lannister was my favorite character. He always knew exactly what needed to be done to secure his family name. I know he gets a lot of hate for the whole ""I hate my son"" thing but back in medieval times an heir like Tyrion would have likely led to revolts and been a huge dishonor to ones family, Tywin just wanted to make sure that House Lannister stayed as honorable and powerful as possible. Also Charles Dance is an amazing actor one of the most talented on the show. I'm going to miss you Tywin."
4,10,The Children,The Hound sure got rocked. 
4,10,The Children,Im proud of my boy Hodor.
4,10,The Children,[deleted]
4,10,The Children,I think I'm rooting for Stannis the Mannis now...this better not mean that he's gonna die.
4,10,The Children,"All is right in the world. Can we stop the series here? Stop the ride, I want to get off while it's safe."
4,10,The Children,[deleted]
4,10,The Children,Tyrion & Tywin are eskimo brothers.
4,10,The Children,Season 5: SuperBran!
4,10,The Children,"I love the show, of course. I can't remember why Arya wanted to go North? Help without season 5 spoilers? "
4,10,The Children,"Wait, if Arys was in the Eyre, and Sansa was in the castle. Why didnt Arya visit her sister? Does Sansa even know if Arya is alive?"
4,10,The Children,"My favourite part was after Tyrion killed Shae... ""Oopsie"""
4,10,The Children,"What was the iron coin arya have to the captain?


Who should actually be king right now?Stannis?


Are tyrion and arya going to the same place?


Why did the white walkers want that baby? What is going on with them in general?"
4,10,The Children,"So, because Jamie is still Kings guard, Tyrion had been sentenced to death and Tywin MIA, would that put Cersei as the ruler of Casterly Rock and head of House Lannister?"
4,10,The Children,"I really wanted the *'In the end, Tywin Lannister did not in fact shit gold'* line at the end. "
4,10,The Children,"So, was Shae a spy from Tywin all time long or was she just recently converted because of the frustration of Tyrion not having sex with her anymore?"
4,10,The Children,"This has probably been asked a million times already but as someone who only watches the show, how do I now transition to the books? Which book do I start with?"
4,10,The Children,THE MANNIS!!
4,10,The Children,"I was pretty underwhelmed by the entire episode. Did not feel like a season finale, then again, they never really do with this show."
4,10,The Children,Was Ser Aliser on the pyre at Castle Black?  I'm surprised we didn't see him one way or the other....
4,10,The Children,I'm actually going to miss Tywin Lannister.
4,10,The Children,HAPPY FUCKING FATHERS DAY TYWIN!
4,10,The Children,Is nobody going to talk about how the short clips we have seen all season showed a dragon shadow fly over kings landing and that failed to come to fruition all season? 
4,10,The Children,"Okay, the special effects of this episode were some of the best I've seen on GoT, TV, and even in movies. The dragons were fucking sweet, but those Wights really blew me away..and with those Children of the Forest grenades, I can't wait to see the awesome magic fantasy stuff to come."
4,10,The Children,"Every scene was awesome! I understand why D&D made the changes.

If you read the books we've spent hundreds of pages with these characters. We don't have that luxury in the shows.

It needs to be simpler. Also, to the average person, reading a 1000 pages of in depth historical fantasy seems like a chore. They just want the highlights and the best scenes.

I enjoyed it. Also, stone heart is better kept for next season for briennes storyline"
4,10,The Children,"Even though I'm disappointed with the number of simplifying changes the show did with this episode, I'm still pretty excited for next season:

[Very vague, cryptic season 5 speculation](#s "" * Arya's world loses its color when she finds religion.
* Tensions mount as a whodunnit unfolds in a snowbound stronghold.
* Tyrion figures ""you only live once"" and has a run-in with a bear.
* Dany gets high with an erstwhile lover.
* Men of the Night's Watch do something for the Watch."") for those curious to get an idea of what *could* happen next season."
4,10,The Children,I was disappointed no one helped that poor man stuck in the tree branches. :(
4,10,The Children,"I'm really excited to see what becomes of Arya. If she or Jon dies, I'll probably be heartbroken.. I was kind of sad about the hound because he grew on me. Sort of like drogo. Not nearly as much, though. I miss drogo. :(


Edit: WOW I JUST REALIZED ONE OF THE DRAGONS NAMES IS DROGON! JUST LIKE DROGO! :O!!"
4,10,The Children,What was with Arya and the iron coin thing with the ship captain at the end? Did I miss something?
4,10,The Children,what were those skeletons attacking bran?
4,10,The Children,"the scene were dany locked up the dragons was the saddest shit ever, the screams.."
4,10,The Children,Can someone make a downvote gif out of Jojen getting repeatedly stabbed?
4,10,The Children,That army of darkness scene was pretty alright. It would have been a way better scene if Bruce Campell came out of the cave to save them with his mighty chin instead of that creepy looking girl.
4,10,The Children,My second favorite character killed my favorite character. Goodbye Lord Tywin!
4,10,The Children,"Kind of felt bad for Jojen. First he's stabbed by a half skeleton zombie, then his throat is slashed by his sister, then blown up by some creepy girl. Traveled all that way just to have that happen quickly."
4,10,The Children,"Fight between Brienne and Hound was awesome(and from what I got from reading spoilers it was deviation from the books where [book fight](#b ""fight was between the Hound and some noname soldiers"")), though I didn't like that camera changed angles several times per second: it was really  hard to follow. "
4,10,The Children,[deleted]
4,10,The Children,[deleted]
4,10,The Children,Gendry better have a damn good story to tell when he pops up next year.
4,10,The Children,In the trailer for this season there was a dragon's shadow over kings landing... I guess that scene didn't make the cut. 
4,10,The Children,"Quite an episode. Quite a few more dead people, a little heartbreak, a little patricide, and crazy magical stuff out of nowhere.

I am very excited to see all the stuff that happens next season."
4,10,The Children,Tyrion has interesting ideas about appropriate Father's Day presents.
4,10,The Children,"I'm so bummed over the lack of Greyjoy action. :'(

Edit: Though I'm glad they finally did some justice to Stannis on the show."
4,10,The Children,I have watched this episode 5 times now.....  Approved
4,10,The Children,My friend and I can't agree on the skeletons by the tree- are they wights from the White Walkers or something else entirely? (Not a reader)
4,10,The Children,So what exactly is goin on with the dragons. Am I the only one lost on this?
4,10,The Children,"Was anyone else surprised at how soon Bran made it to the children of the forest guy? Thats in ADWD. I don't know what to expect with the way the writers are going with the storyline. 
"
4,10,The Children,"Children of the forest, finally!"
4,10,The Children,[removed]
4,10,The Children,Where  can i find the name of the outro song on this episode?
4,10,The Children,What's the iron that arya gave the captain?
4,10,The Children,"How is The Mountain going to ""change""? "
4,10,The Children,"Come on over to r/dragonstone

Please form an orderly line; it should only take a few weeks to sort through all the new residents."
4,10,The Children,"This finale was a whole lot better than last season's for sure. I loved how Bran has finally met Bloodraven and the Children of the Forest. His story is one of my favourites in ADWD so I can't wait for that to progress in Season 5! And, of course, we finally found out that Tywin Lannister does not, in fact, shit gold.

I have to say, as well, the fight between Brienne and The Hound was so well done! I was at the edge of my seat not actually sure who to root for. Until Pod lost Arya...Fuckin' Pod, man..."
4,10,The Children,"Tyrion. Fucking. Lannister. ""Fuck you, dad!"" 

I love this show. Can't wait for S5. "
4,10,The Children,[deleted]
4,10,The Children,[deleted]
4,10,The Children,[removed]
4,10,The Children,"how did Jamie disable the guards outside of Tyrion's door? Did he kill them? If so, that would suck since those guys were just doing their jobs."
4,10,The Children,"When Stannis cleaned the woldlings, I wondered where all the giants and mammuts were that they had in the backpocket?"
4,10,The Children,"My main problem with this episode was with Tyrion's escape.  After he says his fairwell to Jamie, we have a shot of him looking anxious at the foot of the stairs.  I took that to mean that Tryion knows that it is quite possible that the whole thing is a trap.  Then he goes up the stairs where he is told someone will be waiting, and there's nobody there.  I'll have to rewatch the episode, but it seemed at that point there was a big row of candles pointing to Tywin's bed with Shea in it.  Wouldn't Tyrion know at that point that this was a setup??  Also, if we assume that this was Varys's plan all along, to get Tyrion to kill Shea and then kill tywin, then for Varys to take him out on the boat, uhm why exactly??  What does Varys gain by setting this up??"
4,10,The Children,I'm hoping Bran will take over Drogon and rain fiery death on the Bolton army next season.
4,10,The Children,"Ughhh....Now Tywin will never find out Arya had been his cup bearer.  Their interaction at Harrenhal is still one of my favorites of all time in the show, and I'd had such revenge fantasies of Arya eventually sticking that to him in the end."
5,1,The Wars to Come,"When the opening credits rolled, I was like ""oh, interesting, Winterfell's not smo-*ohshit*""."
5,1,The Wars to Come,I laughed so hard when Cersei just ignored Pycelle.  
5,1,The Wars to Come,Stannis' wife is bat shit crazy
5,1,The Wars to Come,I see cousin Lancel went clear
5,1,The Wars to Come,Can we just appreciate Mance's actor. That subtle eye twitch at the thought of being burned alive seemed so genuine
5,1,The Wars to Come,So glad that wasn't Grey Worm!
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Jon Snow taught the kid how to block with his shield, and the kid taught Jon how to shoot people in the heart with arrows, what bros"
5,1,The Wars to Come,"You are a good man, Jon Snow!!! #ProEuthanasia"
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Brienne's segments are basically scooby doo doorway gags by this point...

"
5,1,The Wars to Come,Do you have a moment to talk about our lords The Seven?
5,1,The Wars to Come,"At this point, I feel like we've seen more new Daario ass than old Daario face"
5,1,The Wars to Come,TIL: Dragons do not like being locked in their room.
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Margaery's eyes be all like ""damn bro you got good taste""."
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Who would have thought chaining up dragons might make them slightly miffed at you? Kind of a strange start for Dany, showing her as weak/afraid (with the dragons) and able to be manipulated (by Daario). I feel I'm going to love where Varys and Tyrions storyline is going this season."
5,1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow went full Last of the Mohicans.
5,1,The Wars to Come,54 minutes.  And half the dragon budget gone.  But still awesome. 
5,1,The Wars to Come,Sansa's snappy dialogue with Littlefinger was awesome. Shows how much she's changed from season 1.
5,1,The Wars to Come,"""Are you a virgin"""
5,1,The Wars to Come,Was anyone else immensely satisfied at seeing Robin getting the crap beat out of him?
5,1,The Wars to Come,I bet someone right now is making the gif where Mance Rayder is shot then the camera pans to the kid with the bow nodding.
5,1,The Wars to Come,"A lot of man ass in this episode lol

EDIT: It appears I have misspelled Mannis. I'll allow it."
5,1,The Wars to Come,ARE YOU SERIOUS? SANSA AND BRIENNE WERE THAT FUCKING CLOSE?
5,1,The Wars to Come,">Perhaps we've grown so used to horror, we've forgotten there could be another way

Varys gave us a new motto for /r/GameofThrones

"
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Not gonna lie,  crazy impressed by the casting choice on young Cersi.  Took about 10 seconds before I knew it was supposed to be her. 

Honestly hope to see another flash back or two this season, she had the mannerisms down to a T. "
5,1,The Wars to Come,The actress who played young Cersei totally nailed it.  
5,1,The Wars to Come,[That look](http://imgur.com/x6TnAJo) broke my heart!
5,1,The Wars to Come,Seeing the Bolton sigil at winterfell made me angry
5,1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow ending it swiftly and assuredly. What a bro.
5,1,The Wars to Come,I swear when the episode ended I thought there was still another half hour left 
5,1,The Wars to Come,Puberty hit Tommen like a ton of bricks. 
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Fun drinking game, everytime a Lannister grabs a wineglass/refills their cup, take a drink. If you want to die faster than Mance Rayder, try to keep up glass for glass."
5,1,The Wars to Come,"""There are faster ways to kill yourself.""

I loved Varys this episode.

I was hoping to see some Martells. Maybe next episode though.

Edit: Also hope we get more Margaery this season."
5,1,The Wars to Come,"""The moment they see the stones on his eyes""

5,1,The Wars to Come,* *Stannis will remember that*
5,1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion boot 'n rallied like a champ.
5,1,The Wars to Come,I just loved how Jon Snu didn't give a flying fuck about Melisandre's speech
5,1,The Wars to Come,I can watch 10 hours of Peter Dinklage and Conleth Hill just trying to out-quip one another.
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Varys: The Seven Kingdoms needs someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who could intimidate the high lords and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.

Tyrion: Good luck finding him.

Varys: Who said anything about *him*?

Hillary: lol omg u guys fine"
5,1,The Wars to Come,Loving the dynamic of Daenerys being anti-slavery yet keeping her dragons locked up cause she don't know what the fuck to do with them sassy motherfuckers
5,1,The Wars to Come,WHERES JORAH
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Oof, Sansa rode right past Brienne. That's just mean, D&D."
5,1,The Wars to Come,That shot of Sansa and Littlefinger with Pod and Brienne in the background was perfect. So close yet so far
5,1,The Wars to Come,Peter Dinklage is killing it as usual
5,1,The Wars to Come,Disappointed that there was no Arya
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Shout out to the Mods for removing this sub from /r/all, discussion threads are even better now"
5,1,The Wars to Come,My parents walk in during the gay sex scene. Thanks HBO for the awkwardness. 
5,1,The Wars to Come,Maggy The Frog looks much better than she is described in the book. Also I wish we could've seen Arya this episode.
5,1,The Wars to Come,"There needs to be an edit to the Jon Snow and Mance scene where Ron Howard just dubs over and says: ""Mance had, in fact, made a terrible mistake."""
5,1,The Wars to Come,A good start to the season and I must say HBO go ran smoother than the last premier 
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Drogon is out there somewhere, eating charred lamb nachos while singing Wiz Khalifa's ""Young, Wild and Free""."

5,1,The Wars to Come,"Dany walks in to see her dragons, in the dark - Rhaegal shoot out some flame to turn on the lights, suddenly Viserion sees Dany and freaks out. ""MOM!"" He shouts in a dragon roar. Viserion roars too ""YO BRO WHERE?!"" And Rhaegal shoots out some fire while he runs over. 

They start alternating fire blasts while Dany runs away: ""YO MOM LOOK AT OUR FIRE!""

""YO MOM WHERE U GOIN?"" 

""MOM!?"" Dany runs up the steps.

""MOM WHAT THE FUCK!?"" Rhaegal roars. The doors shut. Rhaegal whaps Viserion with a wing. ""DAMMIT BRO!"""
5,1,The Wars to Come,"I was so proud of Jon for killing Mance. He couldn't bear him suffering and appearing weak, and he did the right thing by shooting the arrow. "
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Melisandre seems to have her eye on Jon in a not-so-good way. Jon may have just pissed off Stannis. 

Also I don't think Jaime really regrets what he did at all. Maybe he didn't want his father to die, but he still wanted Tyrion to live.

Finally it was sad to see Missandei try to get with Grey Worm and be let down. I haven't seen the next 3 episodes, probably won't, but I hope to see Arya soon."
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Varys going all in saving Tyrion.  I dont think I will throw my own shit overboard, let alone someone else's."
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Thanks for keeping it in your pants in front of the dead guy this time, Jamie! "
5,1,The Wars to Come,"First of all, I was actually surprised with Varys. It showed him in one of his truest forms, a good guy. A better way to say it would be more of a vigilante type person. The opening with the Bolton logo on Winterfell hurt me. Jon Snow is a bro, watching out for his brothers and Mance. Young Cersei was still a bitch as old Cersei. What the fuck happened to Lancel? I thought he was modeling after Varys.

>He swings his sword like a girl with palsy.


Best line of Season 5 ever. No doubt. "
5,1,The Wars to Come,"last season when Dany locked up the dragons my thought was ""seriously, do you not think they're going to become more savage if you put them in a dark room and not love them."" this seasons: ""I TOLD YOU!!!"" "

5,1,The Wars to Come,Requesting Olly shooting Mance with the arrow.
5,1,The Wars to Come,I thought that little scene between Margaery and Loras was FANTASTIC. I really like when we get to see her *not* playing the game.
5,1,The Wars to Come,"I think they have combined 3 book characters into one to form Show!Daario.  [ADWD](#b ""He's taken on characteristics of Strong Belwas (fighting pit background, killing Meereen's chamption) and Brown Ben Plum (telling Dany she can't be a Queen without her dragons) in addition to his own."")  I guess it makes sense, but I wonder what that means for the future of the show."
5,1,The Wars to Come,"That felt so short, I can't wait for next episode, but I'd rather wait for it to premier than downloading it."
5,1,The Wars to Come,Jon Snow is a badass.
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Neat nod with Varys telling Tyrion that ""he drank his way across the Narrow Sea"" "
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Hoooooly balls Tyrion to meet Danny? As in Lannister and Targaryen united?

While it would have been nice to hear this in the episode, kudos to the show for illustrating the poignancy of this line through actually seeing the scene itself. "
5,1,The Wars to Come,He didn't give em the satisfaction of watching him burn alive. Jon number 1 best guy! 
5,1,The Wars to Come,Gendry is still rowing I guess.

5,1,The Wars to Come,Unsullibro wanting some intimacy getting his throat slit left me shocked but then I remembered what show I was watching
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Major Departures from the books (POTENTIALLY MASSIVE SPOILERS AT YOUR OWN RISK):

1. OUR FIRST FLASHBACK SCENE YET IN THE TV SERIES

2. They omitted the line in the prophecy that mentioned ""the *valonqar* [AFFC](#b "" wrapping his hands around your throat."" I feel this was a mistake since it was important for establishing Cersei's consistent hatred of Tyrion throughout the series. *Valonqar* is Valyrian for ""little brother."" Cersei believes it refers to Tyrion."") [Book-Reader Speculation Beyond](#b ""Jaime is *also* a younger brother to Cersei by a matter of minutes, leading book-readers to speculate that he will kill Cersei. Additionally ""little brother"" is extremely vague and can refer to any number of major characters who are younger brothers."")

3. [ASOS/Season 4](#b ""Varys doesn not accompany Tyrion after smuggling him out of the Red Keep and disappears."") We also get to see [ADWD/S5E1](#b ""Illyrio again"") in the books. Clearly they just abridged the whole thing. [ADWD](#b ""Tyrion also departs Pentos via an ""alternate"" [Read: SPOILERY] route and it is not explicitly to reach Daenerys."")

4. IIRC The Unsullied killed in a brothel is named ""Stalwart Shield"" in the books, not ""White Rat.""

5. I think it's been said before, but Grey Worm doesn't have any sort of relationship with Missandei (who is ~10 years old) in the books.

6. In the books, Ser Alliser was a Yes Man to Janos Slynt, not the other way around.

7. It's been said already but [Season 4/ASOS](#b ""Jon didn't see Ygritte killed in the books, instead finding her dying afterward. IIRC he didn't burn her personally either (EDIT: This last sentence is incorrect, I recalled incorrectly)."")

8. Sansa [AFFC/Season 4](#b ""is not outright revealed in the books, instead being passed off as Littlefinger's bastard daughter ""Alayne Stone,"" even to the Lords of the Vale like Yohn Royce."") [Season 5 Leaks](#b ""The showrunners have completely discarded this plotline."")

9. Robert/Robin Arryn has been aged up to 13 - in the books he hasn't reached double digits and is so sickly he would never be able to swing a sword.

10. Brienne [AFFC](#b ""is never in the Vale in the books."")

11. Lancel [AFFC](#b ""is not a ""sparrow"" in the books, but is married off to secure connections in the Crownlands after the Battle of the Blackwater. However, he gains a newfound extreme piety while recovering from his wounds and doesn't consummate his marriage, instead spending all of his time in the sept."")

12. Olyvar doesn't exist in the books. Loras [ASOS/Potential Future Spoilers](#b ""is a Kingsguard in the books and thus wouldn't be having sexual relationships."")

13. Again, [ASOS/Season 4](#b ""Varys"") is not present during [ASOS/Season 4](#b ""Tyrion's time is Pentos and by extension reveals nothing about his plots or motives."")

14. Daario Naharis is being combined with the character of Strong Belwas from the books even more. Strong Belwas was an enormously fat but extremely capable fighter who serves as a bodyguard/hired blade to Daenerys [ASOS](#b ""(Barristan is actually introduced disguised as his ""squire"")""). Belwas is the one [ASOS/Season 4](#b ""who defeated the champion of Meereen (which Daario did in season 4)."") Belwas fought in the Fighting Pits and was renowned for allowing his opponents to cut him once before he killed them. He is covered in countless scars as a result. Belwas is a major advocate for reopening the Pits in the books.

15. IIRC there is no dialogue between [ASOS/S5E1](#b ""Jon"") and [ASOS/S5E1](#b ""Mance Rayder"") after [ASOS/Season 4](#b ""the latter is captured by Stannis. He is held in isolation."")

16. In the books [ASOS/Season 4](#b ""Tormund Giantsbane"") is still north of the wall leading [ASOS/Season 4](#b ""the remnants of the Wildling army, not a prisoner of the Night's Watch/Stannis."")

17. IIRC [ASOS/S5E1](#b ""Mance doesn't have ""dignified last words"" with Stannis in the books."") [ADWD](#b ""This is for a reason."")

18. [ADWD/S5E1](#b ""Jon doesn't shoot Mance when he is burned alive in the books."") EDIT: I've been told he [ADWD/S5E1](#b ""Orders the archers to do it, which I appear to have missed completely since I last read."")

Hopefully this is all in line with spoiler policies of this sub. I was careful.

EDIT: I've been informed by the mods that the book spoilers (for ground already covered in the TV series) require notification and coverage. Hopefully I've fixed that."
5,1,The Wars to Come,"I actually really liked this episode, despite most people saying it was underwhelming. I thought the flashback opening was great. That prophecy is definitely something to remember through-out the rest of the series. 

I enjoyed Tyrion's scenes. Surprised more people aren't freaking out about Varys's reveal that he's in camp Targaryen. Maybe it was obvious? I thought I'd see a lot of people hyped about the possibility of Tyrion and Dany meeting up. I thinks it's very cool that we are getting to that part of the series where characters start to intersect. Jon and Stannis, Dany and Tyrion.

I thought Mance's death scene was very powerful. Along with Tormund's reaction and Jon's mercy kill. Really well done. It's a shame to see another great character and great actor go."

5,1,The Wars to Come,Where is Baelish taking Sansa?
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Great episode. I didn't feel the episode was slow at all, but the people watching it with me did. Maybe it's because I've read the books, and you could kind of see the seeds being planted and things. I just felt like the wordplay was great as usual, the acting was superb, just everything was right on. "

5,1,The Wars to Come,Baelish is becoming the new Tywin.  
5,1,The Wars to Come,"I was annoyed that the part where Dany tears down the pyramid statue was just for looks, somewhat. The trailers made it feel like there was going to be a huge revolt against her and that the statue being torn down was going to be a large part of that revolt. Damn whoever made the season 5 trailers!"
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Maybe I missed this in previous seasons, but I'm surprised nobody has commented on the confirmation of cersei/lancel taking out Bobby B. Was that confirmed before this episode?"
5,1,The Wars to Come,"I sure hope Jon Snow mercy killing the king beyond the wall doesn't he is the next person to be burned alive.  Though, it looks like the red witch is getting ready to abuse him in some way."
5,1,The Wars to Come,So I guess Melisandre is the 'Brown with a sort of red hue' Witch now?
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Why can't Daenerys control the dragons anymore? Is it simply because they are HUGE compared to being dragon puppies in earlier seasons? Are they edgy dragon teenagers now with Limp Bizkit shirts?

Or is it some sort of symbolic way to show that Daenerys is losing the grip on all that she's conquered so far?"
5,1,The Wars to Come,My favourite thing to do whilst watching this episode was to see how they framed the shots so that the scenery just so happened to be covering all the penis' flapping around. God forbid we see a penis!

5,1,The Wars to Come,For much of the episode it seemed like it showed just enough to remind you where characters are rather than to drive any plot.

5,1,The Wars to Come,Did the directors change for this season? Something is off. The pacing feels way different. It doesn't feel like Game of Thrones to me. It just feels like a regular show or movie.
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Why did I not see a single nude scene in this episode? Did HBO cut it? I saw a post that there were a lot of male nude scenes. Awwww :((

Also, I miss Jorah. He was a good man and advisor to Dany."

They seem more likely to eat/maim her than do any real damage to her enemies at this point. "

5,1,The Wars to Come,"When the red witch rode up the elevator with Jon Snow my first thought was ""get away from me!"".

I think the red witch frightens me more than any other character.

If Jon Snow doesn't get executed for his mercy killing of the king beyond the wall, it will probably because the red witch has plans for him."
5,1,The Wars to Come,"How do people feel about Mance's decision? I understand it completely but it does seem to only be good for him. If he was the only one able to unite all the Wildling tribes what will happen now? They have to stay south of the wall because Winter is coming and Stannis's offer was actually a good one - EXCEPT that it went against the very nature of free people. The pragmatist in me thinks that perhaps after the long winter, the Wildlings would have a choice - go back to their previous way of life or stay on as recognized citizens of Westeros with land. Doesn't seem so bad. And through that lens, Mance's decision only seems good for himself as the Wildlings now are without a unifying leader and will probably have to fight anyway. I think that's okay as he made the valiant choice and didn't go against his nature. I'm sure he will get the respect he wanted and kudos to John for preserving his honor. Melisandre is gonna be pissed. PS - Why didn't he just ignore her virgin question? Is that her version of small talk? Mind your business fire lady, jeez."

5,1,The Wars to Come,Dat super-slow Rains of Castamere during the scene with Tywin's corpse. It almost made me feel bad. Almost.
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Anyone else psyched that Daenerys finally called her dragons by name?!  I'm certain that this is the first time we've heard the names Viserion and Rhaegal on the show, and possibly even Drogon.  They've always just been ""my dragons"" before.  It's about damn time they got some attention!"

5,1,The Wars to Come,"I shouldn't have been surprised that Sansa literally passed by Brienne... but I was. Oh, and I love you Jon Snow!"
5,1,The Wars to Come,I wanted Jon Snow to rub his hands together and treat Melisandre as a campire.
5,1,The Wars to Come,Tyrion can smell liquor and women from 5 miles away.
5,1,The Wars to Come,"So I'm curious about varys and tyrion's story arc. No golden company? No Jon connington? Also, when are they greyjoys going to show up? "
5,1,The Wars to Come,"So, I'm confused. If Varys has been pro-targaryen this entire time, why on earth would he have sent the order to have danerys killed in season 1? Varys acts with little to no oversight, because he is the only person as good at his job as he is. if he had not sent the assassination order, nobody would have known, and he could have easily said that the attempt went awry. sending the assassination order jeopardizes his entire plan, and gains him nothing in return."

5,1,The Wars to Come,So was the younger better looking queen to replace Cersai referring to Sansa or Danaerys? I think it could go either way.
5,1,The Wars to Come,"Jon Snuh dealing out some Ned Stark justice at the end there has to be one of the best moments in the entire show. The whole episode was solid, but that made me jump up like my sports team just scored the sports ball."

Dany is rapidly fucking things up in Mereen, par for the course. Things were going so poorly, I'm surprised Drogon didn't light the city on fire."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Is it just me, or did Arya getting turned away the first time make zero sense? 

She didn't learn anything by having to go out on her own for a bit. It's just like, the Faceless Man being a dick for no reason. Unless there's something I missed. "

I mean did he just pursue a genocidal policy, ""Let’s kill all these fucking Orcs who are still left over""? Or did he try to redeem them? You never actually see the nitty-gritty of ruling.

This is a snippet from a [very good and SPOILER RIDDDEN](http://observationdeck.io9.com/george-r-r-martin-the-complete-unedited-interview-886117845) interview GRRM gave.

He is talking about Aragorn, but his point is ""ruling is in no way easy"".

As a book reader I find the Meereen chapters enthralling. Many don't like them, and I can see why. 

Politics. Politics is ugly. Meereen is uglier. I think I'll enjoy the show's take on it."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Since her introduction, Shireen has doubled literacy rates in Westeros."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Between Janos Slynt getting rekt by Sam, and Cersei's uncle giving zero fucks what she thinks, this episode had my justice boner at full mast."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"I like how Bronn gets the closest thing GoT has had to a happy ending and then Jamie just comes up and is like: ""Nope. Nope. We can't have that. This is Game of Thrones we're talking about."""

5,2,The House of Black and White,"* Nice to see Arya again!
* I actually didn't expect the Jaqen insta-face swap that was a nice surprise
* Even though their screentime is small I love the exchanges between Tyrion and Varys.
* It's worrying me how little a grip Dany has on her first kingdom, it was definitely gonna be hard but she hasn't even got her Dragons anymore. I worry for her safety."
5,2,The House of Black and White,I can't be the only person thinking that Drogon was about to go all Smaug on the city... Right?
5,2,The House of Black and White,"This episode was so good. I was surprised about how Stannis reacted towards Jon, very honorable of him.

Also Jon Snow 2016"
5,2,The House of Black and White,No man ass in this episode lol. Plenty of Mannis though.
5,2,The House of Black and White,The scenes between Tyrion and Varys are fucking gold. 
5,2,The House of Black and White,A lot of good things happened this episode. Fuck that means someone I like is going to die soon.

5,2,The House of Black and White,"So, happiest GoT episode so far? There wasn't a single part of that episode that wasn't awesome, epic, or doubly epic.

1. Arya in Braavos? Check
2. Brienne of Tarth being a fucking badass? Check
3. Kevan Lannister bein' a MAN? Check
4. JAIME AND BRONN ROADTRIP?! Motherfuckin CHECK
5. Jon Snuu is NC #998 and Sam dropped the mic? Check
6. JAQEN IS BACK BITCHES! CHECK!
7. Drogon sighting? Check

Man what a great episode! I'm so pumped right now!
"
5,2,The House of Black and White,And..... All of Brienne's scenes are done..
5,2,The House of Black and White,"This was very much a set up episode, but it also spawned a bunch of interesting changes I'm looking forward to.

Jaime and Bronn going to Dorne is a great change. Some of my favorite characters in the same place, but enough has been adapted that I'm still not sure what's going to happen.

And bringing Jaqen's actor/character back for the House of Black is another awesome change.

And fortunately we won't have an entire season of Brienne wandering around the Riverlands searching for a maiden of six and ten with auburn hair. "
5,2,The House of Black and White,[deleted]
5,2,The House of Black and White,"As cool as Jon Snow as commander is, I really wanted him to take up Stannis' offer. Lord Jon Stark of Winterfell sounds cash as fuck. "
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Janos, the burn cream is in aisle 5."
5,2,The House of Black and White,I know she gets some hate but I think Emilia's acting has gotten better this season. 
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Notice how Peter said ""My marriage proposal has been accepted."" Very careful wording there. It wasn't ""I'm getting married"" or a derivative of that. Could be interpreted as him getting engaged, or him proposing an engagement.

Is Sansa getting married? Again?"
5,2,The House of Black and White,"So Drogon showed up after Dany had that guy executed.  This is pure speculation, but does anyone else wonder if the dragons will only ""respect"" her as a leader if she is violent?  Seems like something that would make sense given a dragon's nature.

Of course, this would lead to moral dilemmas, like whether or not it's okay to kill people just to keep her awesome, murdery pets.  Kind of like Little Shop of Horrors."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Line of the night for me was ""ITS JAIME FOOKIN' LANNISTER"" along with Tyrion's genius jabs at Varys."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"I really hope Jon Snow doesn't die this season; because if there's anything I've learned from watching Game of Thrones, it's that people who stick to their morals instead of doing what's smart die. 

Oh and I'm glad Daenerys had backlash. You can't just take over a city and disrespect their customs. "
5,2,The House of Black and White,Mhysa ain't nobody's Mhysa anymore.

5,2,The House of Black and White,"* Drogon's rebellious teen years continue! He's just checkin in before he lights some people on fire. Dany needs to get some more badges before she can train him. Seriously though, Drogon looks amazing. Their CGI gets better each season for the dragons.

* Dany....you need to clean up your ruling act. The bad decision making from you is starting to reek of Robb Stark levels of poor decisions and we all know how that ended.

* Fuck yeah Lord Commander Snow.

* But Jon, real talk here. The one true King Stannis Baratheon just generously offered to make you Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. Goddamn it man! Just take that deal! I need me some Jon Stark!In other words Jon, Good guy Stannis is giving you the best deal of your life for your bravery. Your knees best start kneeling on their own soon.

* Stannis. You're a boss my liege. Hopefully Jon will come around and graciously accept your generosity.

* Tyrion is hilarious even at his worst.

* Kevin Lannister is having none of Cersei's shit. I love it!

*  J'AQEN HYPE!!

* Get rekt Janos. Sam brought the smack down on you.


* Brianne officially is the worst at convincing the Stark girls she's there to help them. Maybe you should ditch the Gold Lannister sword that was made from melting down the Stark family's sword Ice.

* Jaime and Bronn Road Trip getting me all giddy.

* Alright. We've seen Dorne and it looks awesome! Now bring on the Sand Snakes!"
5,2,The House of Black and White,“in a puddle of his own making”
5,2,The House of Black and White,A man liked this episode.
5,2,The House of Black and White,"With each episode, I ask myself, is this when Dany finally makes an intelligent decision as queen? And each time I am disappointed. "
5,2,The House of Black and White,I'm really excited to see Arya kick some ass. 
5,2,The House of Black and White,"#FindJorah 

Sponsored by Dany"
5,2,The House of Black and White,What the ever-loving-fuck is with Brianne of Tarth? She's bad at everything except killing people and just keeps ramming her head into a brick wall. I feel for Podrick.
5,2,The House of Black and White,Drogon was just dropping off his laundry. 
5,2,The House of Black and White,"haven't seen it mentioned, but i loved Cersei calling Margaery a ""smirking whore.""  very fitting."
5,2,The House of Black and White,[deleted]
5,2,The House of Black and White,Breanne could've told Sansa that her sister was okay... 
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Is no one gonna talk about my boy Stannis?

 ""I don't punish bravery, I reward it. Lay your sword at my feet and bend the knee. Then arise as Jon Stark Lord of Winterfell"""
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Jon Stark, now there's a fella who sounds like he knows something"
5,2,The House of Black and White,"So I gotta say this, while I was a huge fan of Dany's story through S1-2, it began getting eh by the end of S3 and S4 was just awful to watch for her. I don't mean in the sense that it was bad storytelling, but more so that she made bad decisions. 

With this episode, I feel like she's growing as a ruler. She made a decision, based on reason, based on ""law"", and stuck with it even though it cost her the love of the people in Meereen. A man awaited fair trial and was murdered (although he probably deserved it) and so the man who committed the crime was murdered. 

Needless to say, shit's about to get interesting."
5,2,The House of Black and White,Sam with a burn so severe the lord of light probably considers Janos to have been sacrificed.
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Dany: ""Good thing this mareen thing is like a practice run for the real throne cuz I totally fucked that up LOL"""
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Honestly, not a fan of how they did the Night Commander's election. Sam made it a sly political game in the books. Here it felt like ""Oh no, Thorne is going to win. Time for a big inspirational speech. Oh look, they moved them to vote for Jon. Yay, he's won."" They could have made it more, but it just felt like every other election episode I've seen in tv."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Damn, Drogon's gotten big."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"I find it quite suspicious that Daario was able to sniff that Son of the Harpy out of a wall, then convince the council that since he had already questioned him no one else should bother."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"""Hehe here, Drogon smell my finger""

""Dude fuck you, I'm fucking done"""
5,2,The House of Black and White,People of Mereen don't speak english but they wrote kill the masters in english.
5,2,The House of Black and White,Highlight of the episode was Sam wrecking Janos Slynt's shit. All that was missing from the scene was the mic drop.
5,2,The House of Black and White,Let Arya's Rocky-style training montage begin! 
5,2,The House of Black and White,"I know it's inconsequential, but Stannis offering to make Jon a true Stark made me shed a tear. I put myself in his shoes, that's probably the thing he has ever wanted the most. I know there was no way he'd accept but still, got me emotional and shit."
5,2,The House of Black and White,Sam's little monologue about how Janos Slynt hid with the women and children in a puddle of his own piss during the battle had me rolling. Good for Sam.
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Did anyone else find it strange that Brienne openly used Sansa's name in the tavern, and Petyr didn't do anything to stop her from drawing attention to them? And how the heck did no one else realize that Sansa freakin' Stark was in their presence after that? This scene made absolutely no sense to me."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Everyone is criticizing Dany for her ruling...

Look, I don't even like her character that much, but how does one really rule the clusterfuck that is Mereen? Masters want everything back and the slaves are cherrypicking - they want to keep the benefits of freedom and ALSO keep the good parts of (Mereen-format) slavery.

Not to mention she's sitting on three unstable nukes that are her dragons."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Really strong episode in my opinion. Very entertaining and advanced the plot really well.

Looking forward to this season going forward!"
5,2,The House of Black and White,[deleted]
5,2,The House of Black and White,I think Kevan Lannister might be my new favourite.

5,2,The House of Black and White,Is nobody going to mention how dandy Bronn looks??? Its so great!
5,2,The House of Black and White,Arya is going to be one badass assassin. Fingers crossed that she personally takes Cersei's head.
5,2,The House of Black and White,Jamie's shirt was badass. Looked like a blonde Nathan Drake.
5,2,The House of Black and White,Then Drogon rolls up like: http://i.imgur.com/WV3aa3s.gifv

5,2,The House of Black and White,"Dany, when Barristan told you about the trials, he meant for every criminal thereafter, not just the first one."
5,2,The House of Black and White,Can we talk about Ellaria's unfortunate haircut? 
5,2,The House of Black and White,Hizdahr really sounds like Tyrion.
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Gendry update: still rowing 



(We think)"
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Drogon was the point where you realise Dany doesn't have to do anything.

She rules out of fear. "
5,2,The House of Black and White,"I cant be the only one who thinks that the scene where Jon is Reading the letter from Mrs.Mormont was exellent. ""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North,whose name is Stark."" and then that little smile of him :) It shows how people in the north are still loyal to Starks,Boltons it ain't going to have easy...the Wolves will rise...very soon :D until that im gonna worship the snakes :)"
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Really felt bad for Shireen in this episode. And what a lovely actress! The interaction between Gilly and Shireen felt really special. I mean, dark, of course, but I just enjoy those two characters together. Do they have scenes in the books? "
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Remember when Daeny was being lectured for having no dragons and still wanting to be called the ""Mother of Dragons.""

I think the final scene with Drogon is supposed to be a wake up call for her. She knows she has to go back to her old ways of ruling, just as when she had her dragons. Killing that freed slave seemed right at the time but she now feels as if it was anything but. And when Drogon reappears, she attempts to touch the past, and it flies away from her, leaving her in flux again. "

5,2,The House of Black and White,I felt like Sam was about to go on a twenty minute roast of Janos
5,2,The House of Black and White,Is Podrick loosely modeled after Sancho Panza?
5,2,The House of Black and White,I love Podrick's pathetic attempt at combat. 
5,2,The House of Black and White,"From a book reader, that Doran casting is absolutely perfect. Exactly as I expected: looks, speech, manner. Nice and calm just like Doran should be."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Gendry, still rowing that fucking boat off screen."
5,2,The House of Black and White,We were literally watching the dragon budget fly away during that last scene
5,2,The House of Black and White,I pretty much need a GoT spinoff starring Varys and Tyrion as once disgraced detectives who team up to solve crimes and Tyrion drinks constantly.
5,2,The House of Black and White,"The scene with Doran Martell was stunning. Not how Doran is described in the books but I like the choices they have made with his character. The stern focus in his eyes really drove the self restraint home for me. As the oldest child who has just lost his last sibling it is clear that he wishes he could act on his anger and seek vengeance, but as the ruler of Dorne his duty is to the well being of his people. Part of why Oberyn was ever ""the viper"" is because he was the second son, not bound bye the duties of leadership like Doran. Looking forward to seeing more of him this season as he is one of my favorite characters.
"
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Looks like all the centuries of Targaryen in-breeding are slowly starting to catch up to Daenerys. She had NO desire to even consider Ser Barristan's advice on mercy in the public eye and that's because she's developing that lust for blood and death..just like her father.  Before Aerys II Tagaryen was ever known as *The Mad King* he was *Aerys the Wise* who brought peace to the 7 kingdoms, but his kin are just more prone to madness."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"If I remember the book correctly, when Jon is offered Winterfell by Stannis, he was strongly considering, and had basically decided to go for it.
It was his surprise election to head the Night's Watch that took it off the table for him.

I kind of wish that they showed a bit more of him being torn with the decision, rather than his steadfast refusal. He had a chance to get what he always wanted, but the wall pulled him back in."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"I'm confused, what are little finger and Sansa trying to do?"
5,2,The House of Black and White,honestly i cannot wait for Tyrion to get into an argument/disagreement with Dany in the future episodes. I really wonder how Dany and her arrogance is going to take Tyrion Lannister. 
5,2,The House of Black and White,I don't like Sansa's new voice.
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Stannis awards brave men who disobey him, Dany kills them."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"The camera panned behind Arya's head to hide the face change as a way of saying ""This is what you get when you spend all the VFX budget on Drogon"""
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Should've seen this coming Jaime. Now that Tyrion and Tywin are gone, you're going to be at fault for everything. "

5,2,The House of Black and White,Why was Sunspear not in the intro?  Kind of a lack of attention to detail there.  
5,2,The House of Black and White,"I soo needed Jon Snow to become Lord Commander, I've been hoping for this since he took the black. Although I was kinda wishing he'd join Stannis and bring hell to the Boltans. With the vote being so close I foresee bad blood in the future. Also Dany had to know there'd be trouble executing that guy in public like that. Happy to see Drogon again, back from burning a few villages I hope."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"That hissing before the riot in Mereen was really, really weird. Like a lot of angry cats. 
"
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Great now that you all have seen episode 2 I can say this DANNY IS CLEARLY ROB STARK 2.0

Tyrion made this clear a few seasons ago ""you will find it difficult to rule over millions that want you dead"" 

So what does Danny do she kills a former slave in front of slaves which are the only people in this place that want you alive. NOW EVERYONE HATES YOU. Killing that slave is not going to make the masters like you any more and clearly the slave you killed had your best intentions at heart. She have just put him in prison. 

At the rate she is going I would not be shocked if she died this season because she is acting a fool first the chaining the dragons now this yeah she is asking to die"
5,2,The House of Black and White,Show watcher here: Is the scientist/experimenter that kept the severed head creating some sort of Frankenstein/Mountain hybrid?
5,2,The House of Black and White,God the scenes in Dorne were absolutely beautiful.
5,2,The House of Black and White,"The ending of this episode shows perfectly why this show is great. I was yelling at the TV ""No don't kill him! They'll turn on you!"" And she did it. She executed someone. I get that he shouldn't have killed the assassin but c'mon. I also really like the line where she said ""There are no more slaves. There are no more masters."" to which he replied ""Then who lives in the pyramids?"" Dany always was for equality and her people but now she is living a somewhat lavish life with guards and nice temples etc. Great episode."
5,2,The House of Black and White,[TIL Jaqen H'ghar is sting](http://imgur.com/i3eLl)
5,2,The House of Black and White,Daenerys needs to just go to Westeros and stop messing with this slave shit.
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Great episode. Nice to see Jaqen again. The ending though, did Drogon leave Dany or what? Couldn't figure out if he was pissed or not."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"I'm so hyped to see Bronn again. Hope to see more awesome fights with him.

Poor Stannis. Yet another man refuses to kneel to the true king. "
5,2,The House of Black and White,"When they drop the imps head on the table, look over Cerci's right shoulder. It appears the the mountain may still be in play. There is something great under that sheet. "

5,2,The House of Black and White,Dany would have benefited from Jorah's counsel tonight. No homer.
5,2,The House of Black and White,I really wanted him to be Jon Stark.
5,2,The House of Black and White,I find it odd how Lollys states she hates yellow...while wearing an outfit with a lot of yellow.
5,2,The House of Black and White,"It really bugs me that after everything Dany said, she didn't even give the former slave a trial before publicly executing him.

Edit: I realize now that the scene at Dany's throne was the trial, I forgot that the Queen acts as the sole judge anyways, which bugs me even more."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Arya-Valar Morghullis
Jaqen-Get the fuck out of here"
5,2,The House of Black and White,I wonder if Arya and Jaqen H'ghar only using the black door at the House of Black and White means something. There has to be symbolism involved in everything!
5,2,The House of Black and White,Dany could use the dead bodies from the fighting pit to train the dragons on who they can and cannot eat! I need her to have control of them again :( rogue Drogon makes me sad.

5,2,The House of Black and White,"Anyone else get a little choked up during Sam's speech for Jon?

I'm currently writing the best man speech for my little brother's wedding. I hope I do 1/8th as well as Sam. "
5,2,The House of Black and White,I loved the change in the Sansa/Brienne plot. Having her just randomly find Sansa was hilarious but also very sad. Now Brienne is directly connected to the Little Finger/Sansa story line as she is following Sansa somewhere to be married. This is the kind of changes I like to see on the show.
5,2,The House of Black and White,I really enjoyed watching Shireen teach Gilly how to read. 
5,2,The House of Black and White,"I thought I would make a post regarding [5.02](#s ""Arya and Jaqen""), since from the comments I've seen, I think a lot of show watchers are misinformed/being misled (unless they made major changes in the show).

Minimal book spoilers relating to scenes from this episode:

[AFFC](#b ""The man that changes his face to 'Jaqens' face is not actually the same Jaqen that Arya met before (in season 2). In the book, he is just known as The Kindly Man, and at one point he dons the face that Jaqen used to show that it can be done, and no man by the identity of 'Jaqen' actually exists. I really hope (and don't think) that they would deviate from the book and make that Jaqen. It would be very cheap in my opinion."")"
5,2,The House of Black and White,I loved this episode way more than the 1st one of the season. Love the scene with Drogon!
5,2,The House of Black and White,"HEY BRIENNE - HOW ABOUT SAYING ""I MET ARYA""

5,2,The House of Black and White,I kinda was thinking Drogon was going to set to the city. Just to be like HAAAA GOOOOTTT EEEEEMMMM
5,2,The House of Black and White,Great to see the actor playing Doran. Loved his role in Kingdom of Heaven.
5,2,The House of Black and White,So why did Drogon come back? Is it Cuz she executed someone and he's all about that? I don't read the books. Someone explain to me pleaaaaase.
5,2,The House of Black and White,VALYRIAN STEEL MOTHER FUCKERS
5,2,The House of Black and White,The Knights of the Vale always look so perfectly smarmy.
5,2,The House of Black and White,I think Daenerys did the right thing. She served justice. But a public execution might not have been such a good idea.
5,2,The House of Black and White,Tyrion can't get to meeren soon enough srsly danny is another poor decision away from a revolt
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Lord Commander #998. I immediately thought, who is going to be #1000. This means Jon has to be killed/replaced (maybe joining Stannis?) though.

5,2,The House of Black and White,Brienne with the Valyrian steel! Looked badass shattering that dude. 
5,2,The House of Black and White,It's pretty clear the further the show progresses the more the will be deviating from the books.. But I'm okay with it. I get the impression the end story will be the same. They didn't go into this with the idea they would make it a whole different story from the books.. They wanted to adapt the show in the best way possible for TV. They are working with George and by all accounts know his vision for how the whole saga plays out. I don't think it would be this big and don't think George would endorse it as he does if it was any different. He'll finish the next two books just in time for the show to catch up in my opinion. They can drag the current books out until at least the end of next season if not the season after that and by that time we'll have a new book even thicker than ADWD. This show should have at least three seasons left is my bet 
5,2,The House of Black and White,Ahhhhhhhhhhh Areo Hotah! Finally makes an appearance!
5,2,The House of Black and White,"If the season progresses like this, it's going to be a very flat season. Like they've taken a step back to setup all this stuff that's already been established... I understand some of the reroutes for time's sake (show continuity), but honestly these first two episodes have felt rushed and scrambled together."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"I couldn't understand the 4th and final name on Arya's list. It was Cersei, Walder Fray, the Mountain, and who?

Also, didn't the Mountain die in that duel with the Viper?

EDIT: Nevermind, just found out it was Meryn Trant."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"Does anyone else feel like the whole scene for the election of a new Lord Commander was totally rushed? It just seems like there was no hype and kind of out of nowhere (as compared to the books, where there was more frequent mention of it)."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"I love how it shows that Dany really can't do this on her own for long. She needs Jorah. She 'freed' a slave, then killed him. I thought that was a good representation of ""I think I'm doing good."" And how her freeing isn't always so free.

5,2,The House of Black and White,"I don't understand the actions of councilor who was representing the former slaves. The evidence stacked against the Harpy was so strong that there was no way his trial was going to end any other way then with an execution. Yet he had such little faith in his Queen that he acted brashly, and then what was Daenerys supposed to do? He betrayed her, broke the law, and then expected a pardon. Daenerys had no other choice but to execute him."

5,2,The House of Black and White,"Great episode. As a book reader, I got to admit that I love the way they are changing some storylines. 

While I had very much enjoyed books 4 and 5, these books had a LOT of world-building/not related to the main story material, which is not bad at all, I love the world GRRM created and the more I get to read about it the better. But, while GRRM can kind of get away with this stuff in books and end up with not the best, but still pretty good books, the uneventful side-stories with tons of new (and not very important or interesting, or memorable) characters would just kill the show. 

So it's good to see Jaime and Bronn do some fun stuff instead of being barely mentioned and have some boring guard dude do all this stuff instead. 
Also Brienne, Pod and Sansa stories are looking promising. 

Overall, I am very pleased with the showrunners way of telling the story. It feels like it's the same Ice And Fire story from the books, like all the main characters will end up in the same place and will meet the same destiny  as in the books, but sometimes they will get there in completely different ways. So as long as they are not killing off main characters for the sake of the ratings and DRAMA, I'm 100% on board with all these changes, they absolutely had to be done to do a good show, plus when the show will get ahead of the books, reading them will be just as good just to see everything from a different perspective."
5,2,The House of Black and White,"My take:

Dany, it doesn't matter if your 2 baby dragons snap at you, or if the people hate your decision. Drogon is still your boy. Now go find those who will ride the other two. Dragonfire is what you need to keep people in line, because it will take time for them to learn to value the justice and compassion that you can give them. Your ancestors won the throne by the might of dragons. Your compassion and sense of justice is what will help keep you on that throne. 

Last time they knew Arya she was a vengeful murderous kid. They watched how she handled herself in their city. She can handle a blade in their water dancer style, yet did not immediately turn to violence though outnumbered. She could've just taken all three of those damn without an effort. She knows what they are and still wants in, without being told to follow she follows Jaqen back. It's not just that she symbolically throws away her shit list but that she has shown the other qualities they need to develop into what they need. I don't think that they're just looking for another recruit. She is a highborn and they know it. What piece are they looking to obtain to play in the game of thrones?

And what are they, and why do they have assassins wondering with stress, are they agents of the Iron Bank, are they looking to plant a highborn assassin of their own close to those who owe them a great deal of money and other debt? Is that why Jaqen was in Kings Landing and then stayed with the Lannister  army to be near Tywin? it would've been interesting to see how he would react it if he had been asked to kill Tywin by Arya. I hope we find out more soon.

Jon has to rule with a 40.5% support base and win the support of the independents, like a U.S. President. His opposition has 40%.

So the way I see it, two are being tested in their ability to rule, it will be interesting to see who will be end up riding the other dragons back to Weseros. Sansa is also going somewhere ""far far away"". Littlefingers power could evaporate with the change of regime to a court of Queen Margaery. I wonder if he's going to bet on the winning side being Danaerys. "
5,2,The House of Black and White,I'm going to be extremely disappointed if Brienne keeps getting away with her stupidity and her outrageous luck doesn't run out (she randomly just runs into BOTH stark girls that the entire country couldn't find and instantly recognizes them)

5,3,High Sparrow,"One of my single favorite passages in the novels was represented in tonight's episode..


From ""A Feast for Crows"" (Arya II)

>""It's just a sword,"" she said, aloud this time . . .

>...but it wasn't


>Needle was Robb and Bran and Rickon, her mother and her father, even Sansa. Needle was Winterfell's grey walls, and the laughter of its people. Needle was the summer snows, Old Nan's stories, the heart tree with its red leaves and scary face, the warm earthy smell of the glass gardens, the sound of the north wind rattling the shutters of her room. Needle was Jon Snow's smile. He used to mess my hair and call me ""little sister,"" she remembered, and suddenly there were  tears in her eyes


>Polliver had stolen the sword from her when the Mountain's men took her captive, but when she and the Hound walked into the inn at the crossroads, there it was. The gods wanted me to have it. Not the Seven, nor Him of Many Faces, but her father's gods, the old gods of the north. The Many-Faced God can have the rest, she thought, but he can't have this.

5,3,High Sparrow,"Also.. I posted this in the Live Thread but ""A Game of Thrones"" had a bit of foreshadowing that transpired in tonight's episode...

From ""A Game of Thrones""  (Sansa VI specifically)

>Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead; wishing she could hurt him, wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head."""

Sansa is learning to play the game, is stone cold, and is the KEY and HEIR to the North. Ramsay isn't stupid, and he knows that he needs her. She's also the personification of the legitimacy that he's been longing for. 

I think that the horrifying scene that will happen mid season will be Ramsay torturing someone in front of/with Sansa, like Myranda, his super jealous ex. I think Sansa is going down a dark path this season and will do what is necessary to manipulate Ramsay to her side. "
5,3,High Sparrow,"Even in Westeros, gingers get shit on. I'm glad Jon didn't choose Alister for that job. It shows that he's not after petty revenge, but rewards skill.

That quote had so much power behind it.  I love it!"
5,3,High Sparrow,"So Sansa is back in Winterfell, but she's a completely different person from when she left, and what's more she's surrounded by traitors and sadistic murderers.

Meanwhile, Arya holds on to her last bit of Stark heritage let to her as she refuses to throw away Needle, her last physical reminder of Jon Snow and her family. So much has happened since she got Needle that it's become a part of her that she refuses to let go. Rather, she buries it deep for now.

Speaking of Jon, the new Lord Commander has beheaded Janos Slynt in True Northern fashion, a lesson that was taught to him by Ned Stark. ""The one who passes judgement should swing the sword.""  The Night's Watch is now certain of Jon's commitment to the law and to carrying our justice. He is not a pup that can be chastised and kicked.  He is a direwolf, and a true Stark, and a man of the north. His word is law now.

It's great to see the parallels as well as the contrasts between the three Stark Children.

* IIRC [S5E3](#s ""Pod"") doesn't have this backstory in the books.
* [ACOK?/S5E3](#s ""Brienne's story is only slightly changed from the books. It wasn't a ball in her honor, it was a tournament. Also IIRC in the books she actually was completely oblivious to Renly's homosexuality."")
* It is my personal theory that Olly replaces the book character Satin, who was a new, younger brother and former male prostitute. He serves as one of [ADWD/S5E3](#b ""Jon's FILLERWORD"") stewards in the books and is actively with Jon during the Battle of Castle Black in the books.
* Arya's scene at this point is mostly consistent with the books. [Future Spoilers](#b ""Even if she got rid of Needle, Arya literally cannot become ""No One"" because she still has a part of herself left in Westeros - Nymeria. It has not been shown in the series but *ALL* of the Stark children are wargs."") This is explicitly demonstrated in the books but not (yet) in the show.
* It should be obvious at this point but take a wild guess what the Faceless Men do with the many corpses of the dead.
* Again, [AFFC/S5E3](#b ""Sansa and the Boltons never meet in the books."")
* IIRC this is the first instance of ""The North Remembers"" in the show. SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
* [ADWD/S5E3](#b ""Alliser is never appointed First Ranger in the books, because the actual First Ranger [Benjen Stark] is still not confirmed dead. There is a book-only character named Thoren Smallwood who is at one point appointed ACTING First Ranger - he dies at the Fist of the First Men."")
* TBH this scene was robbed of its highest level of awesome-ness because the character of Dolorous Edd has been likely written out of the show. One of the most quoted lines of the book series to this point is [ADWD/S5E3](#b """"Edd, fetch me a block."""") Otherwise the scene is mostly consistent with the books.
* The scene with the High Septon and the Sparrows doesn't happen in the books.
* In the books, the ""High Sparrow"" isn't met until [AFFC/Future Spoilers](#b ""he is elected High Septon."")
* In the books, the [AFFC/S5E3](#b ""the sitting High Septon is an appointee of Tyrion while he was Hand of the King."") [AFFC/Future Spoilers](#b ""He is murdered in his sleep by one of Cersei's cronies, not imprisoned in the Black Cells."")
* What Qyburn does in his ""spare time"" is not shown in the books.
* Truly excellent physical direction in the [S5E3](#s ""Littlefinger vs Roose Bolton"") scene. Makes me feel sad it never happened in the books. If this comment is cryptic to you...picture the physical positioning of the characters in question as a metaphor for their interaction/political power in the conversation.
* Very little of Volantis was shown - the victim of budget and time constraints. Picture it this way - if Braavos is the expy of Venice, Volantis is the expy of Constantinople or Alexandria. If we'd seen more, it might've been a way to [S3E9](#s ""posthumously"") characterize Talisa Maegyr - if you recall, she was from Volantis.
* Everything with [S5E3](#s ""Tyrion"") is mostly consistent with the books except that - as stated before - [S5E3](#s ""Varys"") is not present at all.

Anything that is labeled ""S5E3"" or less should be safe for non-readers.

FOR BOOK-READERS: IF I HAVE LEFT OUT SOMETHING FROM THE BOOKS, IT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY DELIBERATE DUE TO KNOWLEDGE OF FUTURE SPOILERS. PLEASE DO NOT SPAM BY INBOX WITH ""CORRECTIONS"" OF THAT NATURE.

See y'all next week!"
5,3,High Sparrow,Poor Sansa getting into these horrible arranged marriages with men she clearly dose not want to marry.
5,3,High Sparrow,Holy shit it was great having the full 60 minutes of that episode.
5,3,High Sparrow,"I know Alliser Thorne has always been kind of an antagonist up to this point, but after this episode I hope to see him develop into more of an ally for Jon. Jon showed him the respect he deserves by making him the First Ranger, and now I think Alliser is going to return that respect in the future."
5,3,High Sparrow,[Ramsay and Sansa's wedding night.](http://i.imgur.com/4f0EIIl.gif)
5,3,High Sparrow, It's alive! The Mountain is ALIVE!
5,3,High Sparrow,Can I go like three episodes without worrying about Tyrion's safety??
5,3,High Sparrow,"Can we have a round of applause for Maisie Williams? I was thinking about Jon, and Winterfell, and her father, and Syrio, and the Mountain's men, and all of them in that moment. 

She made it feel like such a near thing. "
5,3,High Sparrow,I think the scene with Margaery and Tommen was the first time we've ever seen anyone drink water on this show.
5,3,High Sparrow,"""It's even luckier to suck a dwarf's cock.""

Maybe my favorite line of the season so far. "
5,3,High Sparrow,"Ramsey's fuck buddy (can't remember her name, starts with an M, but the one that hunted the other poor girl with Ramsey) was giving Sansa a hella nasty look when Ramsey kissed Sansa's hand."
5,3,High Sparrow,What if every time you watched porn a gang of priests burst in and paraded you naked through the streets?
5,3,High Sparrow,"I want to see Sansa recognize Theon, and be like ""What the hell happened to you?!"" And he just look at her and say ""Your new husband."" 

I'm rather interested in seeing where the show takes this plotline.
"
5,3,High Sparrow,"Next time on, Jorah the Explorer "
5,3,High Sparrow,Daenerass.
5,3,High Sparrow,"Governor Swann was so jealous of Captain Jack, he went and declared himself High Sparrow"
5,3,High Sparrow,"Did I interpret Jaqen's/man's line wrong or are they kind of trying to tell us Syrio=Jaqen? 

""There is only one god, and you know his name"""
5,3,High Sparrow,"""Seems like a good job for a ginger"" - Jon Snow 
Ginger jokes even in Game of Thrones gotta love it lol"
5,3,High Sparrow,"""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.""


Jon was making his father proud with that and turning down Stannis."
5,3,High Sparrow,"Anyone else really happy that Jon Snow actually followed through with his order, rather than giving him ""mercy."" "
5,3,High Sparrow,"Ahh got a big fire emblem vibe when Brienne asked Pod about becoming a knight, Pod just ranked up and unlocked new dialogue options!"
5,3,High Sparrow,Poor Ser Pounce will never be the thing Tommen strokes most ever again. His tiny heart is breaking.
5,3,High Sparrow,After seeing Arya in rags and sweeping floors I'm starting to wonder when her fairy godmother is going to appear.
5,3,High Sparrow,"Hey Slynt, know who else was probably afraid? That baby you murdered.

Also, I don't want Ramsay on the same plane of existence as Sansa, much less in the same room."
5,3,High Sparrow,[deleted]
5,3,High Sparrow,"I think this episode has been the better of the three thus far. Arya at the house of black and white was very well done. I also thought briennes story of Renly and her awareness of his sexuality was acted out beautifully.  It reminded me of Theon's about Ed Stark to Ramsay in season 3.  

I'm not sold on the Sansa story line change yet though. However I did like how Roose questioned little finger and obviously remains guarded. Roose & LF going back and forth has potential. "
5,3,High Sparrow,">But Jaqen, what does sweeping have to do with becoming a faceless man?

>But Mr. Miyagi, what does waxing cars have to do with karate?"
5,3,High Sparrow,Sir Friendzone's back for another go at Dany! Woohoo!
5,3,High Sparrow,">Jon glanced back at Stannis. For an instant their eyes met. Then the king nodded and went back inside his tower.

I'm glad they did this right."
5,3,High Sparrow,[removed]
5,3,High Sparrow,What a boring wedding! No one died in this one! 
5,3,High Sparrow,"Is it wrong that I find a broken, drunk Jorah kind of attractive?  For a dude at least"

5,3,High Sparrow,[deleted]
5,3,High Sparrow,"Was hoping for someone to ask Jon why he wasn't using an executioner, just so he could say ""the man who passes the sentence, should swing the sword"""
5,3,High Sparrow,"Can we get a gif of Mance Raydar getting shot by the arrow, stannis turning around and seeing stannis giving a head nod? "
5,3,High Sparrow,"What a fantastic episode.

-Jon's execution of Janos

-The tense conversations between Cersei and the High Sparrow, between Little Finger and Roose, between Cersei and Margaery. 

-Arya's crying (Maise is such a wonderful actress)

-Sansa staring down Roose before curtsying 

"
5,3,High Sparrow,"Ser Friendzone really has hit the absolute bottom. Drinking it up in a whorehouse a world away, and kidnapping dwarves to desperately try and regain Dany's favor."
5,3,High Sparrow,[deleted]
5,3,High Sparrow,Looks like Weatherby Swann has finally embraced the Sparrows. 
5,3,High Sparrow,"I love that Olly is Jon's steward now even though he killed Ygritte. Crows before hoes, I guess. "
5,3,High Sparrow,"This is Jon Snow Lord Commander. Not Jon Snow the 'Bastard' anymore. AMAZING SCENE I can't get over it... the way Alliser Thorne stepped aside really got to me, you can hate Jon all you want but DO NOT spit in the face of thousands of years of Nights Watch order and command. I am really getting to understand Thorne now. Very clever by Jon to give him that position as well, he does deserve respect as a leader even though as a person he's a dick."
5,3,High Sparrow,Oh how I wish it was Jon Snow in Ramsay's position right now. Wait...
5,3,High Sparrow,"""A MAN'S AFFAIRS SHOULD BE HIS OWN!""
Something tells me Pycelle and Bill Cosby would have a lot in common. "
5,3,High Sparrow,"""Cunt!"" lol, love Arya's directness"
5,3,High Sparrow,"""I wish we had some wine for you but it's a bit early for us."" Cersei got fookin rektd. "
5,3,High Sparrow,"So that ending... I assume Jorah meant that he was taking Tyrion to Targaryen queen, not Cersei queen?"
5,3,High Sparrow,"I'm sorry your grace, we don't have any wine.  We don't start drinking this early."
5,3,High Sparrow,I wonder if Jorah slept with that Daenerys looking whore that would be kinda sad. :/
5,3,High Sparrow,That girl slapping Arya scared the shit out of me lmfao
5,3,High Sparrow,"Ama get dat bitch a dwarf, bitches love dwarves."
5,3,High Sparrow,"*pans to Ramsay's girl's looking menacingly at Sansa*  
  
**oh shit**  
  
*old lady servant says, ""The North Remembers""  
  
**oh YES**  
  
I was really worried, but I don't think Sansa is as alone as we thought."
5,3,High Sparrow,A LORDSHIP TO THE MAN WHO MAKES GIFS OF MARGAERY POST COITUS!
5,3,High Sparrow,"I don't know how, but they managed to turn Sansa and Jon and turn them from people I didn't really care for much and turn them into the ones whose fates I have to know what happens next."
5,3,High Sparrow,Brian the Ginger will soon sit on the Iron Throne and convert it into a latrine. 
5,3,High Sparrow,So many Ned callbacks this episode.  And a Stark returns to Winterfell!
5,3,High Sparrow,I like the way Alliser Thorne just goes 'you can have him'. Smart man. 
5,3,High Sparrow,"Whatever Qyburn is cooking up in his weird lab, I hope Ramsey pisses it off someday.  I'm so fucking sick of that asshole, watching his head explode would make me happier than anything that has ever happened on this show."
5,3,High Sparrow,"Jesus Christ littlefinger what the fuck are you up to

I knew Sansa was gonna meet Ramsay at some point. I hope she has picked up some of Baelishs intrigue and gets to kill Roose"
5,3,High Sparrow,"Shoutout to Brienne for her lovely, nostalgic requiem for Prince Renly Baratheon. Look to your sins, King Stannis."
5,3,High Sparrow,Suddenly Ser Pounce becomes very lonely.
5,3,High Sparrow,"Tommen and Margaery can stay King and Queen. I will be happy with that. 
 "
5,3,High Sparrow,Snow just became the hero of anyone whose ever worked in management. 
5,3,High Sparrow,[deleted]
5,3,High Sparrow,"So, did anybody else wonder why Jorah brought a rope and a gag to a brothel?"
5,3,High Sparrow,God damn watching Slynt's head getting chopped off gave me a justice boner.
5,3,High Sparrow,Hopefully Davos's talk with Jon shook some sense into him and he'll join Stannis and march to Winterfell. That way he could liberate his sister from betrothed to another abusive psychopath.
5,3,High Sparrow,Is anyone else annoyed that Brienne has no problem with calling Tyrion the Imp but gets mad by being called Brienne the Beauty?
5,3,High Sparrow,"I like the focus on the Boltons. Theyre presense has been a bit overdue this season. 

Michael Mcelhatton(Roose's actor) said that they will be brought to the spotlight a little so Im quite glad its actually happening(He also said that they are gonna do some ""terrible things to good people"". I can only eagerly speculate on that). I think lord Bolton had more screen time this one episode than all of S2.

I like Roose quite a bit. Can ya tell?"
5,3,High Sparrow,FOUR TIMES? Good for Tommen. 
5,3,High Sparrow,Not many people are mentioning the scene between Pod and Bre. Damn that was some heart warming dialogue. Finally that storyline gets some more heart  
5,3,High Sparrow,Second rate spymaster. Varys would have known Baelish left the Eyrie.
5,3,High Sparrow,So apparently Tyrion can see the subtitles too.
5,3,High Sparrow,Tirion needs to stop going to inns/brothels. Nothing good ever comes out of it. 
5,3,High Sparrow,"One line that's all we needed... ""Fetch me a block"" would've been way more badass than ""grab my sword.""


Stannis's reaction

http://i.imgur.com/8s4QjYv.gif"
5,3,High Sparrow,Tommen GETTIN IT! 
5,3,High Sparrow,What was on the table that was covered with sheets??
5,3,High Sparrow,"I can't really see the ""Lords of the Vale"" being cool with Littlefinger giving Sansa away to the very family that was responsible for murdering Rob and Catelyn Stark."
5,3,High Sparrow,Jon finishing his drink before executing Janos...dudes got his priorities straight.
5,3,High Sparrow,"""It all happened so fast.""
Fuck do I know that feeling."
5,3,High Sparrow,"So now what does Stannis do?

He's got the same number of troops he arrived with. He knows he needs a Stark name to hold the North and didn't get that. 

It might be time to restrategize here. "
5,3,High Sparrow,"""I promise I'll never hurt her"" your promises mean shit Ramsey!!!!"
5,3,High Sparrow,Lord Baelish just went 0-100 real quick on Sansa.
5,3,High Sparrow,lancel acting tough for the first time in his life 
5,3,High Sparrow,Do the Stark boys graduate from some Northern School of Beheading? 
5,3,High Sparrow,"i absolutely loved how quickly ser alliser abandons janos slynt after jon proves he's willing to leave all of their shit in the past, and how jon is able recognize that he's the best fit man to be first ranger.

real recognize real."
5,3,High Sparrow,I love how Jon isn't keeping a grudge against Alliser Thorne
5,3,High Sparrow,[deleted]
5,3,High Sparrow,How many times has Jorah gotten it on with the Kahleesi hooker?
5,3,High Sparrow,I bet they skipped the wine and pie at Tommen's wedding. 
5,3,High Sparrow,"My respect for Margaery sky-rocketed after her snarky comments towards Cersei
"
5,3,High Sparrow,"Mr Steal Your Dwarf, Ser Jorah of the Friendzone. Dude is trying to rack up as many titles as Dany."
5,3,High Sparrow,"I'm thinking Jorah will bring Tyrion to Dany, not Cersei. It doesn't make much sense for them to get Tyrion to another land and spend time establishing him there, just to take him to Cersei again. The only thing I can think of is it gives time for Tommen/ Margery to settle as king/queen, and Margery can get Cersei out of there. Tommen may pardon Tyrion (he doesn't feel guilty over Joffery's death.) But I think it'd be much interesting to see Jorah take Tyrion to Dany, a last ditch effort to get in good with Dany again. "
5,3,High Sparrow,Littlefinger and Sansa up on the hill looking over the land like Mufasa and Simba.
5,3,High Sparrow,"I loved how Janos went out sniveling like a true coward, begging for his life. That made Jon angrier."
5,3,High Sparrow,"This episode was very interesting for me cause it showed possible transitions for a lot of the main characters – Sansa returning to Winterfell to claim her place there, Jon becoming Ned Stark 2.0, Arya becoming faceless, Cersei becoming a sparrow (?? I'm not a book reader but I felt that even Cersei is beginning to realize her uselessness, perhaps she is in the market for a new beginning?)...oh and Tommen becoming a man. With Natalie Dormer...er, Margaery Tyrell. Bastard."
5,3,High Sparrow,Welcome back Ser Friendzone!
5,3,High Sparrow,"I've gone through a lot of the comments and no one has mentioned Qyburns ""friend""! That will be interesting to see."
5,3,High Sparrow,this episode was good because no dany 
5,3,High Sparrow,[removed]
5,3,High Sparrow,"That symbolism with John Snow carrying out the death sentence himself, just like Ned would have done "

>""... *CUNT!*"""
5,3,High Sparrow,">Jon beheads Slynt

>Twenty minutes left in the episode


How can there still be twenty minutes left? I have literally- not figuratively, literally never been more content with any event on the show thus far. "
5,3,High Sparrow,Ser Davos is awesome
5,3,High Sparrow,Did anyone else catch Varys' stare at the Dany impersonator's butt? I need a gif of it lol
5,3,High Sparrow,"One of my favorite parts of the episode was the passive aggressive daggers Cersei and Margaery were trading.

She basically called Cersei an aging alcoholic and let her know that her precious baby wrecked her all night. Amazing."
5,3,High Sparrow,"Why is no one talking about the Mountain?!?! 

HE LIVES!!"
5,3,High Sparrow,"Just wanted to point out the differences in the beheadings of Meeren and Castle black. Both were done for valid reasons.

But in Daenarys' case, all she got was disapproval and John's beheading was seemingly well received by his folks."
5,3,High Sparrow,"As much as I hate Roose Bolton, I respect his intelligence.  The same respect goes for Tywin as well.

Roose is smart enough to realize the delicate position they're in - Ramsay just thinks that if he skins people their problems will go away.  If he didn't do that deal with Littlefinger - who knows when the other Northerners would skin the Boltons."
5,3,High Sparrow,"Anyone else think Stannis, and Baelish could be working together?  ""The North never forgets"", and if there are rumors of a Stark being held captive in Winterfell that could bring a lot of Northern Lords to Stannis' side as he marches south later this season.    "
5,3,High Sparrow,"I love the continuous call backs from the Season 1 about beheading. All of Ned's boys beheaded someone at some point and that beheading it sort of reflection on the character themselves, if not more so, than the person they are beheading. Look at Theon's beheading. It was so ineffective, so lacking in honor, so... unbecoming. Look at Robb's done with feelings clouding the mind (and honestly, I haven't seen it in awhile) he did it with half a heart and no conviction. Compare these two to Jon Snow. Self composed, heavy heart, fully conscious of its consequences and meaning. He did not come to this decision lightly.

I guess we know who the true son of Ned Stark is."
5,3,High Sparrow,"I rarely say this when watching this show, but, that wedding was underwhelming."
5,3,High Sparrow,The one-one interactions this episode were fantastic. Every single one of them
5,3,High Sparrow,"I know there's too many characters to show all of them every episode, but I'm really upset with the amount of screen time Ser Pounce is getting this season."
5,3,High Sparrow,"I'm going to kill you Janos Slynt. Everybody, take him outside. Me, however, I'm gonna sit inside and finish my coffee first. Gotta have my morning coffee at morning meeting"
5,3,High Sparrow,"See Stannis, that is how you execute someone!"
5,3,High Sparrow,Stannis approves.
5,3,High Sparrow,I was worried that Brienne would give up and have nothing interesting to do this season. Now it's looks like she might come face to face with Stannis near Winterfell. Would she team up with the Boltons if she thought she was doing the right thing?
5,3,High Sparrow,"Come on, Sansa, give us a revolution at Winterfell!    "
5,3,High Sparrow,"Hell yeah, Jon, getting your inner Ned on. You wear the look far better than Robb did, that's for sure."
5,3,High Sparrow,"* Jon I love you as Lord Commander. Especially after you laid the law down with Janos. That ssshole finally got what he deserved. Plus dat Stannis nod of approval. I'm so glad they kept that in from the book. The only thing that didn't make it that would have made the scene perfect was ""Ed, fetch me a block"".

* Jon though. Real talk again. Take up Stannis' offer. It is the most generous and reasonable offer you could ever receive. You've even got Davos subtly trying to negotiate the deal with you! Come on man. The Mannis wants you in his army. Join team Mannis today.

* THE NORTH REMEMBERS.

* P.S. I'm sorry Brienne but I have no sympathy for the idiot traitor that Rennly was. He was a usurper and brought his fate upon himself by trying to steal the throne from the true King. If it comes down to Brienne vs Stannis, the Mannis has my complete backing. He's currently the only hope Westeros has of surviving the White Walkers."
5,3,High Sparrow,Petyr would never marry Sansa to Ramsey! She's the key to the north and he's in love with her! Plus he didn't know anything about Ramsey? Bullshit! Petyr would never make a move without researching everyone involved and all possible outcomes. 
5,3,High Sparrow,"I'm curious of why that guy died in the house of black and white.  Was he not worthy of being a faceless man or was he worthy and it was last step into turning him into a faceless man and killing of the rest of his identity or was it just them killing a guy, I got no clue"
5,3,High Sparrow,"Lancel be like: ""nobody expects the Spanish inquisition so here we are motherf**ker!!!"""
5,3,High Sparrow,Jon Snow Really brought the payne this episode. 
5,3,High Sparrow,"Sansa and Ramsey?  Thanks GRRM for fucking us over once again -- can't this guy go a few episoes without breaking our hearts??  

Sansa is going to be raped, skinned alive, and buried by Ramsey... in no particular order.  Or have Reek do it.  "
5,3,High Sparrow,"The scene with Cersei and Margaery Tyrell was one of the best scenes in the show, imo."
5,3,High Sparrow,"So, if the Red Priestess in Volantis is backing Danerys, do we think Mellisendre is secretly working against Stannis, hoping to bring Danerys into power? "
5,3,High Sparrow,All this kidnapping business could have been avoided if Varys had just stopped to buy Tyrion a book or something. 
5,3,High Sparrow,"I completely forget, but what happened to Gendry (sp)?  "
5,3,High Sparrow,"""Who needs money when you can make a woman laugh"" -Tyrion fucking Lannister"

5,3,High Sparrow,"So Tonmen is Half Lion Half Stag, but in the sack, he is all bunny. "

5,3,High Sparrow,Arya getting emotional over Needle was great.
5,3,High Sparrow,Soooo Jorah isnt taking the friendzone well.
5,3,High Sparrow,The plot is now so vastly different from the books that I'm curious to see what will happen in terms of continuity moving forward
5,3,High Sparrow,"I'd have sex with Natalie Dormer every day, every hour if she was willing.

Also, why is beheadings the common punishments in all of Westeros?"
5,3,High Sparrow,"Is Jon giving Stannis the Mannis some kind of confused boner with all of the bravery, oath keeping and beheading? "
5,3,High Sparrow,"Can we keep the ""John Bro"" nickname going strong throughout this season ? "
5,3,High Sparrow,"I have been waiting to see if they would d the scene where Janos gets his up and comings, and they did not disappoint!  Suck it ""LORD"" Janos!"
5,3,High Sparrow,I hope the sudden aging of Tommen doesn't mean the death of Sir Pounce.  Sir Pounce always adds playfulness to the bedroom scenes.
5,3,High Sparrow,"So, who was the body on Maester Frankenstein's table? Was it still the Mountain[?](#or was it lady Stoneheart?) I didn't read the books so I'm not sure if this person's arc has already passed them by and will be left out, or if there's still hope."
5,3,High Sparrow,"Very much enjoyed the scenes between Tyrion and Varys this episode, really reminds me of Arya and The Hound :("
5,3,High Sparrow,Am I the only one who is worried because of Jon taking that dudes head?  Getting Robert beheading the Karstark vibes.
5,3,High Sparrow,It was hilarious watching Jorah 's face in the brothel with all of the Mother of Dragons look a likes in there!
5,3,High Sparrow,No one noticed Walda Frey. I like how they put detail on the show. She wore the upside-down flayed man sigil.   Roose Bolton married her for alliance with the Freys I guess?
5,3,High Sparrow,I see Jorah spent the time constructively after his exile: Drinking heavily.
5,3,High Sparrow,"just when you think Sansa couldn't get anyone worse than Joffery.

Also I never thought I would cry over a freaking sword."
5,3,High Sparrow,"Severe lack of ""Fetch me a block"""
5,3,High Sparrow,2/10 Head nod stannis cmon bro 
5,3,High Sparrow,Hmm. Margaery didn't exactly come across as...inexperienced...after the consummation. Something tells me that wasn't her first time.
5,3,High Sparrow,"Nice cut from flayed bodies to roast chicken. Very subtle. 

Also, Ramsay, don't speak with your mouth full, you disgusting little shit."
5,3,High Sparrow,Why is no one talking about the mountainenstein monster....he's gonna be awesome!
5,3,High Sparrow,"Bye, Bye Janos Slynt :)"
5,3,High Sparrow,"Jon is being a real bad-ass this season, loving it "
5,3,High Sparrow,"I absolutely love the Cersei/Margaery scenes this season. Sneaky, sneaky bitches. ;3"
5,3,High Sparrow,[Pod about to learn how to use the other kind of sword.](http://i.imgur.com/UC0Nmmg.png)
5,3,High Sparrow,So what happened to Bran and Hodor? We're three episodes in and we've seen nothing.  
5,3,High Sparrow,How much is Sansa looking like Catelyn!? had to do a double take a few times!
5,3,High Sparrow,"Jorah is taking Tyrion to Danni, right?"
5,3,High Sparrow,"Thank you for Stannis's nod, D&D. Thank you. "
5,3,High Sparrow,This season has been on point this year. I have no complaints 
5,3,High Sparrow,"""I Have FRIENDS! Powerful Friends in the Capital! You'll See!"" - Janos Slynt hahahaha"
5,3,High Sparrow,"Margaery's going to get her ass murdered or tossed into a cold room by Cersei, I swear to God; she's throwing more shade than the Red Woman. 

As a sidenote, love Arya's inability to throw away her identity entirely. "
5,3,High Sparrow,"I gotta say, so much shit went down I thought this was episode 9. Nope, just #3!"
5,3,High Sparrow,"DAE think Jon Snow might reconsider Stannis' offer even after his refusal. I understand him wanting to be honorable like his father, but like Stannis said he has enemies at Castle Black and that honorable traits were a double edge sword for Ned that got him killed in the end and the look on Ser Alliser's face showed he wasn't happy."
5,3,High Sparrow,"Jon Snow is a badass
"
5,3,High Sparrow,"* *""what are you doing?""*

5,3,High Sparrow,"I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess that the Tyrion and Jorah show is going to be less fun than the Tyrion and Varys show, and a *lot* less fun than the Arya and Hound show. "
5,3,High Sparrow,"Why did Jaqen tell Arya that she could kill specific people for revenge becoming a faceless man? It seems like she wouldn't be able to as they are only allowed to kill people that are named (?) and must give up her own identity. If Arya is not Arya how can she be a tool for revenge? Somehow I doubt the rule on identity is supposed to be broken, but Jaqen does seem to break the name kill rule to allow Arya to escape."
5,3,High Sparrow,Tommen is now my hero. 
5,3,High Sparrow,I wonder if Jon's execution of Janos served a sense of approval to Stannis as he was watching it all happen in the background.

5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"I liked how Tyrion correctly guessed Jorah's entire character, and Jorah didn't even bother correcting him. Just pimpslapped the fuck out of him."
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,I really wish there was a spin-off that just followed the story from Tommen's point of view so we could see just how out of touch with everything he really is.

5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"People keep bringing up that Selmy was defeated by some goober in a mask with a dagger. I think something being overlooked is that the city was known for its fighting pits and champion fighters. The Sons of the Harpy are still masked, and at least one Meeranese is pissed off at the pits being closed; is it not possible that the Harpys in the corridor were all seasoned warriors? Yes, Barristan was the best swordsman in Westeros with the most wins in single-combat, but up against a bunch of hardened pitfighters, winning is still going to be a stretch.  "
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"What a cliffhanger, Khaleesi is going to fucking turn Meereen into ashes. Jon Snow still knows nothing. It was really nice seeing a soft side to [Stannis](http://i.imgur.com/9nV1BSo.jpg) this week. Episode felt *way* too short though.

5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"So this is number four in my Book/Show Departures posts. Again, a reminder that SPOILERS AT YOUR OWN RISK, though all marked S5E4 or earlier should not be a danger if you're completely caught up in the show. From now on, all of these posts will be posted at *least* an hour later than before. I like watching episodes twice - once to enjoy them, once to write these - and will no longer be able to watch it the first time beforehand. Also, I do make mistakes in these posts that require correction by later posts.

**Book/Show Departures**

* The books at this point had another character with Tyrion, named [ADWD/Potential Future Spoilers](#b ""Penny. She was also a dwarf, and had been part of a 'dwarf jousting' act at Joffrey's wedding. Her brother had been killed by amateur bounty hunters who had hoped to claim the bounty on Tyrion and mistook her brother for him. Penny recognizes Tyrion in Volantis and ends up 'tagging along' when he is kidnapped by Jorah. She also has a pet pig named Pretty that had been part of her act. Penny was extremely naive and was IIRC intended as a lighter foil to the dark and cynical Tyrion."")
* As mentioned in one of these previous posts, Mace Tyrell was not part of [AFFC/S5E2](#s ""Cersei's"") camp but was instead allied with [AFFC/S5E2](#s ""Kevan"") and IIRC away from the capital while [AFFC/S5E2](#s ""Cersei"") is in charge. Needless to say, this means [AFFC/S5E4](#s ""He doesn't get sent to Braavos to deal with the Iron Bank. By extension, Meryn doesn't go with him."")
* [AFFC/S5E4](#s ""Cersei grants the High Sparrow permission to reform the Faith Militant."") This happened in the books, but under different circumstances: [AFFC/Future Spoilers](#b ""It didn't happen until the High Sparrow officially became High Septon. It was a political move intended to get the Faith to forgive the Crown's debt to them, as well as part of Cersei's overarching scheme of the books. Needless to say, I think, this is a monumental blunder on Cersei's part."") Also, [AFFC/S5E4](#s ""Loras Tyrell was not arrested by the Faith Militant. His homosexuality was not widely known, and is never explicitly shown in the books, only implied."") Finally, the [AFFC/S5E4](#s ""Faith Militant"") is split into two different orders - [AFFC/S5E4](#b ""the Poor Fellows and the Warrior's Sons. The Poor Fellows are basically faithful who guard pilgrims on the roads. The Warrior's Sons are more classical 'Paladins' in the D&D sense."")
* [AFFC/S5E4](#b ""Tommen never stands up to his mother like this in the books."") He also never tries to visit [S5E4](#s ""the High Sparrow."") Again, in the books [AFFC/S5E4](#b ""Tommen"") is something like 8-10 years old and is very passive, naive, and ignorant, preferring to play with his cats all day. He only really appears in the books when they need official documents signed and sealed.
* My memory of the details of ADWD's Wall plotline is quite fuzzy, but IIRC [ADWD/S5E4](#b ""Melisandre meets with Jon but never tries to seduce him."") EDIT: Apparently this is wrong
* Any scenes with Stannis alone, without Davos or Melisandre, happen ""off-screen"" in the books. Stannis is not a POV character in the books, and his story is told through Davos and Melisandre. Additionally, [ADWD/Potential Future Spoilers](#b ""By this point I believe Davos has been sent away on a diplomatic mission around the North."") Also, Shireen hugging her father is prime reaction gif material.
* Again, [AFFC/S5E4](#b ""Sansa has yet to revisit Winterfell in the books, as her storyline remains in the Vale."") Also, we *FINALLY* get some *much-needed* backstory on how Robert's Rebellion began!
* [AFFC/S5E4](#b ""Littlefinger is putting all his chips on the table and completely outlining a major part of his plan to the audience."") Needless to say, this doesn't happen in the books. In fact, throughout the books, the audience is seriously left in the dark about what is *really* going on behind the scenes for much of the series, and we're forced to piece together the truth based on the various small reveals from many different characters that occur as time progresses. This would be quite difficult for the average TV audience to follow, and so they're by necessity dumping exposition and ""spoilers"" in order to keep everyone from being confused and wondering too many things.
* Since [AFFC/S5E4](#b ""Jaime is in the Riverlands in the books, as said before, a fight with some Dornishmen never happens."") [AFFC/Potential Future Spoilers](#b ""The gist of Jaime's storyline in AFFC is his transformation from reckless, violent fighter into a Guile Hero, to use troperspeak. The loss of his hand forces him to rely on words rather than swordplay to solve his problems...and he finds he's rather good at the former when he puts his mind to it."")
* In the books, there are eight* Sand Snakes - four daughters by Ellaria Sand, and three by other women. The four by Ellaria are younger than the others, IIRC all still in minority. I think all the younger ones have been written out to save screen-time and budget. Also, [AFFC/S5E4](#b ""in the books Doran has Ellaria and all the Sand Snakes preemptively imprisoned, because he knows they will try to retaliate against Myrcella for Oberyn's death."")
* We are getting some serious info-dump on Rhaegar's posthumous character. Just an interesting observation.
* Here we go, this is the *insane* cliffhanger departure that makes this episode. [ADWD/S5E4](#b ""Ambushes by the Harpy's Sons do happen in the books, and continuously escalate, but Grey Worm and Barristan are never victims of them. A lot of people have speculated that Grey Worm will die this season, but I don't think anyone expected Barristan to die as well."") [ADWD/Potential Future Spoilers](#b ""It's seriously up in the air whether or not this 'death' sticks. Barristan plays a key role in the books later on, but because the series isn't restricted by POV 'rules' as the books are, this role may no longer be necessary. We'll have to tune in next week."")

EDIT: Additionally, for all the people complaining about [S5E4](#s ""Barristan's 'lame' death scene, keep in mind that he was alone, against ~10-12 men, and completely unarmored. I view as a case of 'Reality Ensues' - does anyone here know how hard it is in real life to fight ten men at once?"")

Edit: I forgot about the Greyjoy Rebellion, where he personally led the assault on Old Wyk."
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"This show has never really made me mad before, but BULLSHIT on the fact that a single Unsullied would have went down in that fight. They're a legendary fighting force, fully armored and armed, against a ragtag group of untrained men wearing robes and brandishing knives. Absolutely absurd. "
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"I agree that it's bullshit the Unsullied didn't utilize their phalanx training in that fight, serious mistake.

But seriously, get off Selmy's back. He took down 10 guys on his own, in a cramped space, while old as fuck and not wearing any armor. He might be the greatest knight in the realm, but age takes a toll on us all, and when your usual fighting style is dependant on having armor, shit's gonna go bad.

5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"People complaining that Barristan died too easily. Well...

1. He killed at least 10 guys before he got overwhelmed by *numbers*, and that's all the Sons of the Harpy had on their side, numbers. If you bring enough guys, you can overwhelm even the most badass of soldiers!

2. He was 60/70 years old, well past his prime. He might have the same skills he had 30 years ago, but he won't move and react as fast.

3. He wasn't wearing armor, he was a Kings Guard most of his life, and they always wore armor. Fighting without armor, no matter how skilled you are is incredibly risky needless to say."
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,Weren't the unsullied like in the perfect position to kill all of the ambushers since it's a confined space they have a perfect formation and they have a shield and spears - that's pretty much how Alexander the great won all of his wars and if we're talking about movies - 300?

5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck jesus christ. Unsullied are fucking trained to fight in fucking formation before they can even walk. FOR FUCK SAKE THAT WAS HORRIBLE
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"When I saw the boat all I could think was ""GENDRYS BACK BABY!""

Was disappointed by the punch."
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,Love the Dangerous Titties music that they played when Jon grabbed those titties.
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"I was pretty disappointed with how the Unsullied fared in the fighting. Sure, the two guys in the courtyard surrounded by like 8 wouldn't stand a chance unless they were trained like knights with knight's armor, but Grey Worm's group should have wrecked those guys with the good ol' phalanx. "
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,I don't much about the sparrows. I thought were all pacifist jesus-y and Ghandi-y. Then they get some swords in their hands and they go ballistic. What am I missing here?
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,How was Greyworm the only good Unsullied fighter? Isn't this what they have trained their whole life for?

5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,Looks like Arya is going to be scratching someone off her list soon. 
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,I really like Marge's acting in that scene with Tommen after her brother was imprissoned. Really felt like she was barely main ting her composure.

""YEAH BARRISTON TO THE FUCKING RESCUE. Y'ALL MFERS ABOUT TO GET REKT""

wait wtf? He can't get stabbed...

WAIT. WHAT? WTF IS GOING ON?!

AAAAGH WTF? The greatest fighter on two continents can't be brought down like this. NOT LIKE THIS! T.T"
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"These first four episodes have almost felt like a season premier stretched into four hours. None of the major storylines have had any real movement yet, it's all been setup. I feel like they're not using their time very wisely, especially since the episodes are running shorter. It's still a good show and very watchable, but so far this is the weakest season. 

The Meereen storyline is as pointless and meandering as ever, the Arya karate kid training is pretty dull, the sandsnakes are slightly silly and poorly developed and Brienne is still failing at getting out of Jamie's friend zone via finding the Stark girls. I know that Kings Landing and the North will heat up but it is looking to be interminably slow. "
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,The sand snakes are a bit of a let down. 
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"Well, on the bright side, Barry going down means there might be a job opening for J-Bear. "
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,This episode legitimately upset me. Now I know how non-book readers feel when good characters just DIE with no warning.
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,[deleted]
5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"Oh man, I tried not to, but I *really* want to rant about the reaction to Barristan and Unsullied being killed ""too easy"".

First of all - why does everyone takes the stories and legends about great fighters or battles as 100% absolute truth? Of course the stories about great victories of Unsullied will be exaggerated, and while they still are great fighters, they trained mostly for large scale army-on-army combat and got ambushed and surrounded in a friggin tight corridor, with little time to adjust and regroup. 

Secondly, why the hell do so many people have this mentality of ""oh, so in the books 3k Unsullied beat 15k Dothraki horsemen, and 1 Dothraki horseman = at least 5 shitty harpies, so to kill 10 Unsullied there must have been at least 300+ harpies"" this is not how this fighting shit works guys, come on! 

And Barristan, even if he says or thinks he can kill 5 guards, doesn't mean he would pull it off in an actual combat, and everyone refers to it like it's an established fact. And even if he could, fighting without heavy armor must be a completely different thing where his skill with a sword just doesn't matter that much when 10+ fucking guys are charging at him at the same time from all directions.

It's just so weird to see people freak out when a 70-years old grandpa just straight up cuts through 10+ guys, but gets stabbed in the process, because it's not ""badass"" enough.

I'm actually more pissed that they decided to kill him off at all, but not about how they did it. Seems like people are just asking for cliched scenes of *super heroic warrior death* with some shitty slo-mo and sad music and AT LEAST 100 bodies of dead extras around him."

5,4,The Sons of the Harpy,"As a book reader, almost none of what happened in tonight's episode took place in the books. But I still enjoyed the FUCK out of it. That last battle with the Sons of the Harpy was easily one of the best fight sequences in the show thus far. And I also loved the Stannis - Shireen scene they threw in. Kinda makes you like Stannis more. But at the same time that makes me nervous... Because right when you start to like a character...."

-Grey Worm can't be dead, they can't do this to us.....

ETA - I did like the scenes with the Faith Militant, Cercie playing the game- Margie now knows why people do not fuck with Cercie.

5,5,Kill the Boy,I feel like Jorah needs to scale it back a bit 
5,5,Kill the Boy,only mildly upset that the closing credits song wasn't the ELO classic Turn to Stone 
5,5,Kill the Boy,JORAH HAS MOTHERFUCKING GREYSCALE!!!!!!!!!! NOOOOOO!!!!
5,5,Kill the Boy,Jorah is omega fucked.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Jesus, what the fuck, don't fucking make me think Tyrion is dead!! I almost had a fucking heart attack"
5,5,Kill the Boy,[removed]
5,5,Kill the Boy,"So they are substituting [ADWD](#b ""Jon Connington"") with Jorah Mormont. This should be interesting. Will he make it back to his love Danaerys in time?! 

Also THE NORTH REMEMBERS"
5,5,Kill the Boy,Everything in Winterfell feels like the first part of a horror movie.  Where everything just feels *wrong* and you know something awful is about to happen and the anticipation is worse than the inevitable horrible stuff.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Totally redeemed themselves this week. So many great moments and beautiful shots. Really well directed. 

Loved this episode. "
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Ser Jorah had blue balls.
But now we call him Grey Balls."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Can someone explain to me who the Stonemen are and why greyscale is so bad. 

Edit: spelling "
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Fantastic acting by Iwan and Alfie tonight. Ramsay is starting to piss me off. I can't wait to get me some Arya time next week. Also, Jorah is gonna be in the next Fantastic Four movie, so there's a plus.


Edit: To those of you saying ""He is just *starting* to piss you off?"" Yes. He is an incredibly written and interesting character, and he steals every scene he is in. I never *liked* him as a person, but as a character, up until tonight, it has been incredibly satisfying to watch him play mind games with people. I just don't like when people we care about (Sansa) get thrown into the mix. Theon is a different story, though. A small part of me still cares about him, but who knows. Valar Morghulis."
5,5,Kill the Boy,Roose's dad speech was a little less touching than the one Stannis gave last week.
5,5,Kill the Boy,The only thing getting greyscale right now is my heart. 
5,5,Kill the Boy,I'm a huge Jorah fan and am devastated at the ending but hold out hope some Far East cure can save him from greyscale

Stannis ""Fewer.""
Davos ""What?""
Stannis ""Nothing..""

Oh Stannis <3"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I'm so disappointed Roose didn't say [ADWD not really spoilers](#b ""Don't make me rue the day I raped your mother"")"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Last week, Stannis the Mannis and Shireen had one of the most heartwarming scenes we'll ever see on the show.

This week, Roose and Ramsay had a pretty similar scene, except for the whole ""I raped your mother and almost threw you in a river"" part."
5,5,Kill the Boy,Well shit.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Brienne of Tarth: ""Who do you serve.""

Old Guy: ""I just serve the food"""
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Anything labeled S5E5 or earlier should be safe for show-watchers.

**Book/Show Departures**

* The scene where [S5E5](#s ""Dany feeds/threatens to feed some Meereenese nobles to her dragons"") does not occur in the books.
* In the books, there is a rather complicated Wall subplot early on in ADWD involving [ADWD](#b ""Mance Rayder's son."") That particular character appears to have been completely written out of the show. [ADWD/Potential Future Spoilers](#b ""A heavy emphasis is made on Melisandre's rituals needing 'king's blood' to work most effectively. Since Mance was technically a king, his son has 'king's blood.' Jon sends him away under Gilly and Sam's care to Oldtown, passing off Gilly's son as Mance's. There's more to this sub-plot that can possibly be saved for later. It's just at this point, Sam, Gilly, and Aemon are no longer at the Wall."")
* I'll reiterate that Tormund Giantsbane [ASOS/S4E9](#b ""was never captured in the books and Jon has to negotiate with him to bring the remnants of Mance's army through the Wall to avoid them being killed by the White Walkers; not convince him to take leadership of thee wildlings while in captivity, as happens in the show."")
* Tormund does not insist that [ADWD/S5E5](#b ""Jon accompany them to Hardhome. I assume it happens in the show because they want a main character present at the scene."")
* DOLOROUS EDD LIVES (joke about his screentime, he's not dead in the books)
* I'm really starting to believe the book-reader theory that [Future Spoilers](#b ""Olly will replace Bowen Marsh in 'For The Watch'"") and I too am starting to hate it.
* I reiterate that *everything* involving Brienne and Sansa is completely new territory.
* [ADWD?](#b ""Roose Bolton had a living son before the books began, named Domeric. Domeric sought to 'reform' his bastard half-brother and brought him into his retinue. It's heavily implied that Ramsay murdered Domeric, or at least indirectly caused his death. Draw speculation on the future from there."")
* They had some flaming heart figurines made awfully fast
* They're really going all in on STANNIS THE MANNIS this season and it's great.
* [ADWD/S5E5](#b ""Selyse and Shireen absolutely did NOT accompany Stannis's army marching through the North, because it's a really stupid thing to do. I'm actually shocked they forced such a stupid decision on Stannis in the show considering how they've been characterizing him so far this season."")
* I reiterate that [ADWD/S5E5](#b ""at this point Davos is not with Stannis and was sent on a diplomatic mission, long before Stannis started marching from the Wall."")
* [ADWD/S5E5](#b ""Melisandre ALSO stayed at the Wall in the books. It's actually a rather *significant* sign regarding the future in the books that she isn't in the series."")
* I reiterate that in the books Missandei is ~10 and there is no shipping between her and [S5E5](#s ""Grey Worm."")
* Yeah, this [ADWD/S5E5](#s ""marriage"") is pretty ""WTF"" in the books as well, considering the grand scheme of things
* Well, the whole [S5E5](#s ""Jorah takes Tyrion through Valyria"") is totally new and a ""WTF"" to book-readers. It's heavily implied in the books that the place is like a cross between the Bermuda Triangle and an apocalyptic wasteland. Here it seems [ADWD](#b ""it's been crossed with The Sorrows/Chroyane, a ghost city on the Rhoyne infested by greyscale-infected Stone Men. That encounter of Tyrion's occurred before Volantis, during his MASSIVE BOOK SPOILERS AHOY"")
* OH SNAP, Jorah has officially been crossed with [ADWD/Future Spoilers](#b ""Jon Connington"")"
5,5,Kill the Boy,Did Danny imply she was gonna marry the guy in the cell? I missed that.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Roose Bolton continues to be a student of the school of reasonable villainy, unlike his son. Evil Frodo is begging for a comeuppance."

5,5,Kill the Boy,[deleted]
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Fuck Ramsay. I don't give a shit, ban me from /r/dreadfort. Roose and Ramsay deserve the slowest and most painful deaths imaginable."

5,5,Kill the Boy,Davos and Princess Shireen need to be the next Arya and The Hound.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Ramsey is still a crazy psycho, but I got a laugh out of him asking Roose if Walda was actually pregnant or she just got fatter.  Also wondering how Roose could do the deed."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Holyshit, I'll just leave this here.  Ser Barristan Selmy entry in the White Book.

*Ser Barristan of House Selmy. Firstborn son of Ser Lyonel Selmy of Harvest Hall. Served as a squire to Ser Manfred Swann. Named The Bold in his 10th year when he donned borrowed armor to appear as a mystery knight in the tourney of Blackhaven, where he was defeated and unmasked by Duncan, Prince of Dragonflies.

I know most of you have no clue about how amazing the people are that Barristan defeated during his life.  

RIP Ser, one of the best to ever live.

5,5,Kill the Boy,"Melisandre giving Jon Snow one last ""this could be us but you playing"" stare. "
5,5,Kill the Boy,did anyone else notice the timing of jon snow just when maester aemon just said that being the last targaryen must be lonely. *wink* 
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I think this is the strongest episode of the season so far... in one word ""Continuity""..  just really strong story progression..  I felt the drama without a bunch of shock jock tactics...  spending extended time in one region really gave the feeling of the story finally making a move forward..."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"when Sansa was walking through the Kennel I hoped she would find a Dire Wolf, Such a bummer 
"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"* So how contagious is grayscale? Can Jorah infect people even though he only has a little?
* How disorienting was this episode for book readers? Are things differing greatly? (Don't need specifics)
* Nice to see Winterfell again I really hope the Boltons gets BTFO
* Dany wtf? I refuse to believe it's not a ploy to uncover the guy as a harpy
* I'm starting to see why a lot of you love Stannis the Mannis"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I really hope before Stannis takes Winterfell, he sits down with Roose and gives him a few pointers on how to talk to his kids without being such a creepy fucker."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I just realized that having Jon go with the Wildlings means no Jon - Sansa reunion if Stannis takes Winterfell.

That makes me kinda sad"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I would be fine if during the trip from the Wall to Winterfell, the group *accidentally* left Selyse stranded somewhere by herself."
5,5,Kill the Boy,Has Danny completely given up on returning to Westeros? I can't imagine she can rule both Meereen and the Seven Kingdoms at the same time.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Stannis: Decisive, detail-oriented, good managerial skills.

Dany: Fickle as shit.

Just sayin.
"
5,5,Kill the Boy,Well they found a way to bring zombie cliches into Game of Thrones.
5,5,Kill the Boy,Bryan Cogman really knows how to bring everything together nicely. 
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Really hope Jorah finds a cure for grey scale I don't want to see him transform or die.
"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"No. Not my favorite character. Not Jorah. Not grayscale.

Looks like Beinoff & Weiss are learning from GRRM."
5,5,Kill the Boy,the fuck jorah
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Jorah asking if they touched Tyrion is the same as saying ""Who farted?"" when it was really you all along."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"While watching the Valyria scene for a second time, I noticed that you can see the [Stone](http://i.imgur.com/gUBP0Cl.png)[men](http://i.imgur.com/Ntzq3Kl.png) in the wide shots before Jorah and Tyrion get up to them. Really cool detail. Aw man that scene was awesome."
5,5,Kill the Boy,Am I the only one who finds Ramsay more and more entertaining? I feel like he believes he's part of a sitcom or something. 
5,5,Kill the Boy,"J-BEAR NOOOOOOOOOO!!!

More seriously, I knew from the moment they left without Griff that it was going to be Jorah, as Tyrion has to much plot armor to be killed off.

I wonder if he's going to touch anyone important though now that he has it."
5,5,Kill the Boy,Can someone explain the stoned men? Are they like zombies? I don't remember this being explained in the show but maybe I forgot.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I freaking LOVED this episode. So tense. So much cool stuff. Can we just talk about how this is the first time, book or show, where we actually get to *see* Valyria and, for the show at least, get some backdrop on what happened? This was an incredible episode. Some people will probably criticize that nothing much happened, but considering how slow some of GoT's setup episodes are, this one has tons going on: 

* Sansa knows Theon is alive and she about to kill errbody up in dis bitch.
* Stannis is officially marching on Winterfell and the Boltons are officially preparing for war.
* Jorah and Tyrion are roadtripping through Old Valyria.
* Dany is reopening the fighting pits and marrying Hizdahr zo Loraq.
* Fat Walda is preggers. RIP Fat Walda. 
* Jon is going sailing with Tormund. Whee! Also all of the Night's Watch hates him."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Shoutout to story editor Bryan Cogman for writing a fantastic episode that included my favorite visual moment from book five (the boat through Valyria), and line of dialogue that struck me the hardest personally from book five (kill the boy). I see he didn't get ""written by"" credit at the top and his work should be recognized. "
5,5,Kill the Boy,"""The Army of the Dead is coming...""

5,5,Kill the Boy,"One of the many favorite quotes of the night: 

""Sullen silences and the occasional punch in the face, the Mormont way."" 

I freaking love Tyrion. "
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I can't wait for some more, *Jamie & Bronn: Adventure to Dorne* next week"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Interested to see a what Jorah's role is going forward. Will Daenerys take him back as one of her closest advisers? I could see it end both ways, but I get the feeling that he'll get imprisoned and he'll spread grey scale in Mereen. 

Also, shit is about to go down in the north. "
5,5,Kill the Boy,I get all warm inside when the north remembers. Also did anyone else enjoy Roose's giant wine cup.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"This episode cemented just how vile Roose Bolton is, no wonder Ramsay turned out so fucked up."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Ramsey is such a hypocritical prick. It's like he doesn't even want to marry Sansa.  
He made Reek apologise for 'killing' her brothers and said, ""the north remembers.""   
YOU DON'T GET TO SAY THAT WHEN YOUR DAD (WHO KILLED HER BROTHER AND MOTHER) IS SAT ACROSS THE TABLE!"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"So Stannis marches on Winterfell, and Brienne is there, and I'm scared"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"[ADWD](#b ""I think young Ollie is going to be the first one to stab Jon Snow."")"
5,5,Kill the Boy,I would totally watch a sitcom featuring Ramsay and his father called The Boltons. 
5,5,Kill the Boy,Brace yourself. Wedding episodes are coming. 
5,5,Kill the Boy,OH no. Stannis is turning out to be a likable character.. Thats never a good thing in GoT.......
5,5,Kill the Boy,">Maester Aemon: ""A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing""

SUBTLE"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Being the last Targaryen, must be so lonely.

Queue Jon Snow."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Stannis, the Grammar Nazi is back?! thanks for the occasional grammar lessons Stannis, you are truly the Mannis."
5,5,Kill the Boy,">fewer 

Stannis confirmed for a grammar nazi."
5,5,Kill the Boy,Ser Jorah Mor-nu-mont
5,5,Kill the Boy,[deleted]
5,5,Kill the Boy,"""She was pretty in a common sort of way""

Cold blooded by Roose"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I personally enjoyed when Dany stated that her husband to be was already on his knees, and was the head of an ancient and great household. Especially when it immediately cut to Tyrion on his knees on the boat. Maybe I am thinking too much into the imagery and how it was edited on the screen, but I feel that Tyrion may end up being her new suitor after all is said and done."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"""Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?"" 
     ""Yeah. A new squire, you little shit"""
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Man I was actually a fan of Jorah before this episode but he's just being a total dick to Tyrion.  First he doesn't let him drink, then he goes and gets stoned and doesn't share with Tyrion at all."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"JORAH JORAH JORAH, The *Stone*r"
5,5,Kill the Boy,Holy shit seeing the stone men was awesome! Does this mean that Jorah is doomed to die though? :(
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Best episode of the season so far... The stonemen were really frightening, that sequence paid off really well.. I thought the episode would leave on the Tyrion cliffhanger like it did in the books, but then again they'd be fooling no one with that.  "
5,5,Kill the Boy,Jorah is making a bad move not telling Tyrion about the greyscale.  I have a feeling he's gonna spread it by mistake.  Jorah doesn't have a great history of decision making.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Yes, Davos, the battle conversation is surely what is going to scare Shireen, not her creepy mother. "
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I really liked the scene between Stannis and Sam. Stannis telling Sam to ""keep on reading"" gives the idea that Sam's purpose is to figure out how to deal with the white walker threat and prepare the Night's Watch. I think that is a pretty interesting arc for Sam to have and something to tie him into the story deeper."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"But seriously guys, that scene with Jon and Maester Aemon...

[Theory](#g ""'A Targaryen alone in the world. What a terrible thing.' Camera smoothly pans to Jon. Lingers there for a moment too long. Wait for it... wait for it... AND THE CROWD GOES WILD."")"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I'm super bummed that Ser Barristan turned out to be dead. The greatest swordsman in the world taken out by 5 lackluster mooks to try to add some juice to a stupid side plot that seems to be designed to stall until Tyrion and Jorah get there and it gets interesting again.

I also thought it was a bit... dishonest that Grey Worm rallies and saves the old guy from getting his throat cut before collapsing, but that didn't actually matter."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I'm finding it very difficult to care about anything that happens in Mereen until Tyrion arrives. Especially Dany's chain of fuckups. Especially especially the forced, pointless love story between Grey Worm and Missandei."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I'm gunna say it - I love Ramsey.

He's so absolutely evil and twisted, he's like Joffrey without the whineyness and petulance, who gets shit done.

Want the ironborn out of hte north? Let's mutilate and mentally destroy their heir.  
This conversation's awkward. Hey, Sansa. This guy who killed your brotherse is the closest thing to a living relative you have now so he'll give you away. You know, because your dad is dead. And your mum. And your sister is missing. And did I mention your brothers are dead?

He sees the line, then goes so far past it the line he can't even see the line any more. The line is a dot to him. "
5,5,Kill the Boy,I don't ever want to see another fucking Grey worm/Missendai scene. 
5,5,Kill the Boy,Roose and Fat Walda are the cutest couple in the show right now :)
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Wait he can just take a ""shortcut"" through Valyria? I thought Valyria was far Southwest?"
5,5,Kill the Boy,I totally thought Ramsay was going to break Reek's hand there.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"""Fewer"""
5,5,Kill the Boy,Really impressed with Jon at the moment. He's making the tough call even though he'll get burned for it. 
5,5,Kill the Boy,JORAH THE EXPLORER
5,5,Kill the Boy,I pity the fool who told Stannis to his face that he should send his daughter to the stone men.
5,5,Kill the Boy,More like Jorah Greymont if you know what i mean
5,5,Kill the Boy,HOLD UP https://youtu.be/OLNFloNdJH4
5,5,Kill the Boy,"The Whole Greyscale thing has been brought up a whole bunch this season. I expect there to be some connection to the asian red priestess talking about praying to save the people from greyscale while Tyrion watched, to Jorah and hopefully a cure for him."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I don't know why I expected to see direwolves when Sansa went into the kennels.

Also good job Sansa on that burn to the Boltons. "
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Can I just say that the CGI and production of this show has ruined me forever? I try watching Once Upon a Time which has two CGI dragons in it, and I fucking laugh every time. HBO has completely blown it out of the park here. Nothing can compete with it. "
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Am I the only one thinking that not only Jorah lied about not being touched by the Stone men, but also Tyrion?"
5,5,Kill the Boy,Jorah is that one guy in every zombie movie that hides his zombie bite from the group. I always hate that guy.
5,5,Kill the Boy,Not going to lie. I thought Ramsay was going to make Reek give him a BJ...'shudder'...
5,5,Kill the Boy,[removed]
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I dunno how you guys all posted so fast. This and /r/asoiaf have been nothing but server error's for me for the past 5 minutes.

5,5,Kill the Boy,"Jesus Christ, Ramsay."
5,5,Kill the Boy,Thank god grey worm is alive and getting some action 
5,5,Kill the Boy,"i absolutely loved this episode, dont know why but i really liked, maybe because i was tired of cersei's bitching"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"*Is that a fucking dragon?*

**SPLASH**

"
5,5,Kill the Boy,Does anybody else feel like Brienne just doesn't have anything else to do and is just protecting Sansa because she wouldn't be doing anything otherwise?
5,5,Kill the Boy,Rose should do Ramsay a favor and bust him back down to bastard so he can marry Myranda. Looks like she can handle his crazy.
5,5,Kill the Boy,Stannis is now one of my most likable characters.....and he's about to march into battle... aaaaand his daughter just casually asked about the crypts of Winterfell. God damnit I hope he survives this season. 
5,5,Kill the Boy,The North is going fuck up Roose if something happens to Sansa now.  They got them a Stark back and they remember...dammit.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Am I the only one who felt that Jon's entrance when he came to talk to Maester Aegon [ADWD](#s ""was really significant?  'A Targaeryn alone in the world... it's a terrible thing...' .. and then a slow, significant pan to Jon Snow, standing in the doorway, all alone.  At this point, with all the foreshadowing and direct hints going on this season, I feel like I'm going to be angry if the R+L=J thing isn't actually true."")


"
5,5,Kill the Boy,"I know Ramsey's probably longing to murder her and whatever true-born children she gives Roose, but I love how Fat Walda looks so happy when he calls her mother. She's so innocent. She's like a breath of fresh air in the grim Bolton household."
5,5,Kill the Boy,So much Bolton this episode. I love it.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Sam: ""Books are important, Gilly. Without knowledge and learning man would be no better than an animal.""

Gilly: ""So, I'm an animal?""

Sam: ""Er...crap."""
5,5,Kill the Boy,imagine being the guy that has to clean up the dragons' shit
5,5,Kill the Boy,I thought the whole scene at dinner with Ramsay making Theon apologize to Sansa for killing her brothers was incredibly awkward given Roose was sitting RIGHT THERE.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"*""You shouldn't be here.""*

Reek can sense the changes in the timeline. He is the Guinan of Westeros."
5,5,Kill the Boy,Phew another episode with no sand snakes thank god.

5,5,Kill the Boy,D&D trying to play with our heart strings at the end there with Tyrion.

5,5,Kill the Boy,"""Long sullen silences punctuated by the occasional punch in the face - the Mormont Way""

I LOLed."
5,5,Kill the Boy,Jorah is shown in the fighting pit during the season 5 trailer so I'd assume we know 1. he gets to Meereen 2. lives long enough/is strong enough to somehow battle in the pits?
5,5,Kill the Boy,"Danerys: i am declarin war on all who sell drugs in this community!
Hzdar: but danerys, i sell drugs in the community."
5,5,Kill the Boy,"So, a few weeks ago, Daenerys publicly executes a slave to demonstrate the importance of maintaining justice, with the slave's crime being murdering a man without trial. This week, Dany feeds a noble of Mereen to her dragon. Without a Trial. Eh. Her storyline really lacks consistency. I figured we'd get some kind of development from the public execution of the slave, such as how it affected the former slaves' opinion of her, but the show has just moved on from that."
5,5,Kill the Boy,Iwan Rheon is so terrifying and strangely fascinating. What a scary hobbit.
5,5,Kill the Boy,The recaps at the beginning of the episode made me think something bad was going to happen to Shireen. Thank goodness it was just foreshadowing Jorah getting screwed.
5,5,Kill the Boy,"The good: Sansa in winterfell, John Snow helping out wildlings at the wall, the stone men scene, Stannis the Mannis being a grammar Nazi  
The bad: No LeBronne Jaime, Cersei, or Arya(and barely any Tyrion or Dany for that matter):(  
The ugly: Greyworm's cringe-worthy scene with Missandei. I haven't really had issue with their storyline so far but that dialogue was cringe-inducing. "
5,5,Kill the Boy,Does anyone else think Hizdahr is leader of the son's of the Harpy?
5,5,Kill the Boy,> So Barristan's biggest regret is serving a man who burned his enemies to death and in response to his death Dany-
5,5,Kill the Boy,"We got a mild dose of Targaryen madness through Dan**aerys**, and a massive dose of Targaryen greatness through Maester Aemon. The Valyrian ruins were also pretty awesome. Stannis continues to be the mannis, Roose Bolton doesn't need a Sam Jackson to put the pushin to the cushion, and the Stonemen are basically rabid lepers. This show is at its best when it's informative."
5,5,Kill the Boy,Danny is given them dragons a taste of human flesh and it seems they are enjoying it ... sounds like a very good idea
5,5,Kill the Boy,"The Valyrian scene was pretty epic, especially with the dragon. I also think Valyria is kinda based on Rome/Pompeii. A big empire lost with its rich heritage and advanced culture, only the ruins of aquaducts."

5,5,Kill the Boy,"So do you think Drogon was just passing through Valyria or do you think he's being drawn there by something? Since Valyria was home to dragons and the families which controlled them (like the Targaryens) then it's reasonable to assume there's something there that attracts them.

Maybe the key to Daenerys controlling her dragons lies in Valyria? I'll bet Jorah + Tyrion arrive in Mereen and inform her that they saw Drogon in Valyria, which might lead to her going there eventually. "

5,5,Kill the Boy,"Who wrote to  Maester Aemon updating him about Daenerys doings in Slaver's Bay? Those who know what is going on in Mereen and care about Daenerys do not know about Aemon, those that do know about Aemon, Pycelle and Varys, are not informed to update him about what is going on in Mereen. Varys must be going nuts about losing Tyrion; Pycelle, a Lannister loyalist, doesn't care about Aemon and if anything would spread lies about the Targaryans. So who is Aemons correspondent?"

5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken","Opinions this episode:

1. Tyrion and Jorah is the new Hound and Arya.

2. Speaking of Arya, holy shit, the room with the faces was awesome and just how I imagined it.

3. Petyr Baelish may be a snake but he's becoming one of my most liked characters, although leaving Sansa behind and alone was fucked up.

4. The entire Dorne sequence was bad. Bronn had some fun dialogue but the Sand Snakes seem to be the most terribly written characters on the show. Also, I forgot Myrcella thinks Jaime is her uncle and I lol'd.

5. Tommen is a piece of shit. Cersei is dumb. The Armed Faith are fucking cuckoo and shit's about to go down.

6. I DON'T EVEN WANNA TALK ABOUT SANSA OR THE WINTERFELL SCENES. I feel so bad for her and I really, really, really hope some good is about to happen for her. I know the differences in the books and I *wish* they went that way because Show Sansa can never catch a fucking break.  
6A. Going off that, I sense Sansa reaching out to Theon and lighting that candle in the tower in the near future.

EDIT: Spectacular acting by everyone at Winterfell. Not so spectacular for everyone in Dorne.

Also some other comments. Spoilers labeled S5E6 or earlier should be safe for show-only watchers. ALL OTHER SPOILERS ARE AVAILABLE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This post is quite longer (and later) than I'd originally expected because of the addition of my own commentary on the significance of certain divergences that I *seriously* disagree with. This is probably the first episode in the entire series to date that I feel is *bad*, at least in terms of writing.

* [ASOS/S4E10](#s ""Hehe, confirmation that the Hound is not confirmed dead. This is as happened in the books."")
* Jorah knows that feel, bro
* IIRC Jorah never learned of [ASOS/S3](#b ""his father's death"") in the books.
* And at last, the ""dark secret"" of the Faceless Men is revealed. Several episodes ago, I said this should have been obvious from the start (of the season at least), and still got questions about it (which I couldn't reveal). Perhaps I will phrase it more succinctly now: [ADWD/S5E6](#b ""'What possible use could a group of assassins who can regularly change faces have for dead people?'"")
* IIRC they have also abridged Arya's post-ASOS storyline somewhat: [ADWD](#b ""In the books (before this reveal) she did not spend her time in Braavos entirely in the House of Black and White. She would regularly assume false identities of her own design and venture out into town to learn how to blend into the city."") It seems they pushed forward the reveal and pushed back what's in these spoiler tags, judging by [S5E2](#s ""Jaqen's"") lines.
* As an aside, I'm *seriously* confused as to where [S5E3](#s ""Jorah and Tyrion"") are supposed to be right now, in terms of the world map. It's completely at odds with how the region around Valyria/Slaver's Bay was described in the books.
* In the books, [ADWD/S5E6](#b ""Jorah, Tyrion, and Penny (book-only character) were captured by slavers when their ship was waylaid at sea. Also, Tyrion was not considered 'worthless' for being a dwarf - he would be *extremely valuable* as a 'grotesque,' as in a fascinating addition to a 'freak show' in a master's household."")
* In the books, [AFFC/S5E6](#b ""Littlefinger has yet to return to King's Landing, instead remaining in the Vale with Sansa and Robin Arryn."") Again, Sansa's storyline has been completely changed.
* Yet again, in the books [AFFC/S5E6](#b ""Loras is a member of the Kingsguard, and is also the youngest of three Tyrell sons. Cersei 'gets rid' of him by sending him to lead the assault on Dragonstone, where Stannis left a small garrison."") [AFFC](#b ""There, Loras is reportedly *severely* wounded by boiling oil thrown on him while scaling the walls."") [Book Speculation](#g ""It has been theorized by some book-readers that this is a lie by the Tyrells to lull Cersei into a false sense of greater security."")
* [S5E6](#s ""Obviously, Littlefinger never plots to have himself named Warden of the *North*, of all things. IIRC the title actually cannot be changed once bestowed."") [AFFC](#b ""In the books, IIRC Cersei is conflicted with naming Robert Arryn Warden of the *East* due to his youth and sickly health, and prefers to award Littlefinger the title due to his apparent loyalty. The Lords of the Vale object to this and it contributes to their dislike of and conflict with Littlefinger."")
* Again, Myrcella Baratheon and Trystane Martell are quite a bit younger in the books, being in their tweens. Marriage at that age is out of the question, even in Westeros.
* I mean, YMMV but I don't think Dorne has a large area of rolling, grassy hills in any part of it.
* Okay, the Dorne subplot is really making me go ""what the shit"" because it has none of the subtlety it had in the books. I mean, generally the Dorne thread in the books was not well-liked by readers because it had ""Shaggy Dog Story"" vibes but this is just going off the deep end. I'm going to be frank here - I didn't hate the Sand Snake introduction like most people (especially book-readers) did, but I *really* do not like this fight scene. It's sending a lot of characters off the rails from how they were characterized in the books. I'll try to explain these divergences/complaints as briefly as possible (truly I never thought I'd have to do a post like this, but this scene gave me The Walking Dead PTSD flashbacks).
* The whole [AFFC/S5E6](#s ""'the Sand Snakes were even given an opportunity to make an attempt on Jaime/Bronn/Myrcella's lives' detracts from Doran's character. I've mentioned before that in the books Doran preemptively imprisoned the Sand Snakes *explicitly to prevent such a thing from happening.* It demonstrated that Doran was a very cautious yet very shrewd planner and diplomat."")
* Trystane is actually portrayed as *smarter* than his book counterpart - in the books, he is frequently beaten at cyvasse (fantasy chess) by Myrcella
* Areo Hotah is *extremely* stoic in the books, to the point he almost never speaks. The decision to have him [S5E6](#b ""fake going for a decapitation of Jaime in to make a point(?)"") baffles me.
* Cersei is seriously a dumbass. I mean, before this scene with Olenna I might have hid the last statement with spoilers but at this point they've dropped all semblance of subtlety that she's walking toward a cliff.
* I suddenly see just how much Cersei/Margaery's AFFC plot is diverging, and why they had Margaery and Tommen get married and have sex. They appear to be cutting the original plot and creating an entirely new one - I think this is really stupid and I don't like it at all. [AFFC/Potential Future Spoilers](#b ""In the books, Margaery's virginity (or lack thereof) is an extremely important plot point - she has been married and widowed twice now, and will be engaged to the very young Tommen for some time. Cersei basically pulls a 'What Henry VIII did to Anne Boelyn' plot against her (which would actually be a hilarious in-joke considering Margaery is played by Natalie Dormer) - she fabricates evidence that Margaery has been having illicit affairs with numerous male courtiers via torture-induced 'confessions.' This is a completely logical and believable plot because we have *real-life precedent*."") [S5E6/Show Speculation](#g ""Obviously, Cersei is aiming to orchestrate Margaery's fall from grace via perjury. IMO this is completely absurd as a cause for the downfall of a *queen* in times such as these, even against a resurgent powerful church."") Also, we are not being shown [AFFC/Future Spoilers](#b ""Cersei's numerous *actual* affairs with numerous male and female courtiers, which makes me wonder how the writers are going to cause Cersei's downfall."")
* I, as well as all book-readers, knew this final scene was coming the moment the radical change in Sansa's plotline was revealed. I'll say first that it was a well-acted and well-written EDIT: (And by well-written I mean the dialogue) sequence - the tension was truly palpable throughout. However, I hated every second of it, and knew from the start that I was going to hate it. However, first I will provide context regarding the divergences here before I give my personal reasons for hating this scene. I'm going to take a risk and assume that the following part of the ADWD Winterfell plotline has been completely axed on the show: [ADWD/S5E6](#b ""I've mentioned before that in the books, there was a character named Jeyne Poole. She was the childhood companion of Sansa, and accompanied her to King's Landing. She was captured after the whole 'Ned tried to oust Joffrey' thing, and was sent to one of Littelfinger's brothels to be 'trained.' She suddenly reappeared in ADWD posing as Arya Stark, sent north by the Lannisters to marry Ramsay and cement both the Lannister-Bolton alliance as well as Bolton over-lordship of the North. What I didn't mention then was that she was explicitly raped by Ramsay on their wedding night as Sansa was here, which was repeated every day afterward. Ramsay also forced Theon to participate rather than just watch. Jeyne was pretty much a catatonic wreck by the end of the book."") Any further elaboration on this plotline at this point will lead to certain future spoilers.
* Now, on to my personal reasons for why I *really hate* this radical change to Sansa's plotline. [AFFC/S5E6/Speculation](#g ""In the books, Sansa is obviously still a virgin. I view it as a defining part of her book character - once she loses it, I strongly suspect that will be THE turning point where she firmly loses all her remaining naivete and becomes a manipulative, cynical, scheming bitch who achieves real power. This is why I feel 'Sansa gets raped' is completely at odds to how her character has been developed in BOTH the books and show - someone being raped is a reflection of their LACK of power in a situation; in both fiction and real life, it tends to cause someone's will to be broken, thus causing a descent into depression and worse. There are many characters who get raped - both literally and symbolically - in the books, and IIRC *all* of them become miserable, near-catatonic wrecks, all but shells of their former selves (examples being Theon, Jeyne Poole, and Pia). tl;dr, this seems like a COMPLETE 180 regarding the direction Sansa's character seemed to be heading."") But that's just my opinion. EDIT: [This post in /r/asoiaf (SPOILERS AT OWN RISK) really sums it up better than I do here](https://np.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/36bnf7/well_it_happened_spoilers_all/crcj32z)

To be perfectly honest, this is kind of how I felt after watching *The Walking Dead*'s season 4 episode ""The Grove,"" which was the exact episode where I started questioning *everything* about the writing in future episodes. I no longer watch *The Walking Dead*. I really hope Game of Thrones isn't following the same path, because I really do have to see this to the end."

When it comes to everyone's disappointment that Sansa didn't manage Ramsey or seduce him or take a little bit of control by maybe acting like Margery did with Joffery we need to remember a few things. The first major thing being that she is a virgin while it is very heavily implied that Margery is NOT. That means that Margery has already been given the knowledge of how sex should go and potentially how to use it to your advantage. I bet if Margery was in her place she would have known exactly how to approach sex with Ramsey in order to ensure she was not just ""used.""  But there is a reason we know she could do that it's because she is sexually experienced and has obviously been taught by her grandmother from an early age how to manipulate.


Sansa on the other hand, is still a student when it comes to manipulation. On top of that we have to remember what being a female virgin is really like it what is essentially the Middle Ages. Females of her age or any female that is a virgin within this era have no idea how to be sexual, much less seduce a psycho (and understand what could potentially arouse him in a mutually beneficial way). We also know from Sansa's conversation last season with Margery how little she truly understands about how sex works. So my long winded response is basically that expecting Sansa to go in being some vixen is extremely unrealistic and even expecting her to go in that room and be able to picture what would happen is unrealistic. 


In an abstract way I think Sansa understood what rape was and what I would potentially physically be like but without even knowing what sex is physically like we can't expect much except a horrible rape scene and even then it may have still ended up a horrible rape scene"

In Defense of the Black Wedding (SPOILERS)

Let me start with the unnecessary disclaimer: I didn’t want the scene to happen. I love Sansa. Her and Little Finger’s arc has been my favorite of the season, possibly the series as the whole.  In my happy dream world they would wander off together and spin manipulative plots and conquer Westeros. But that’s not what happened.  Nor should it.

The Black Wedding night scene isn’t surprising that it happened, it’s that the show went through with it.  Game of Thrones decided to be brutally honest, and I would argue mature, with its viewer.  To anyone who was surprised by the scene, my request is that you be painfully honest with yourself and ask what did you really think was going to happen?  Did you think someone was going to come in and save her or Ramsay would have just been sweet? Did you hope Theon was going to have some turn of character and jump in to save her? She probably did too.  The truth is what happened is exactly what should have. We all knew that. The only shocking part was that the show made sure to make it uncomfortable, in a clear and unapologetic manner. The viewer got a nice taste of what it is like to be Theon. We watched Sansa grow up, and then we watched in pain and horror as she was forced to “..become a woman.”  Depending on what happens in the future with her character that statement might hold multiple degrees of truth.

I understand that it was painful, hell I’d probably be a little more messed up by it if I wasn’t coming off a glowing Mad Men binge. I also sympathize with people who wanted to see the books (and the storyline they loved) come to life in a spectacular visual way, and the series is now deviating from that. That’s legit and unfortunate, but it is what it is and the Game has changed.

If nothing else I have to give respect that GOT effectively looked the viewer in the eye and asked “What show did you think you were watching?”  No one gets out of GOT unscathed, and honestly Sansa has dodged enough bullets without the inevitable occurring.  Arya had to kill to get where she is, to see and shed blood.  We didn’t want this to happen to Sansa, but I didn’t want Ned to be executed either. If GOT has communicated anything clearly, it’s that when given the chance horrible people will do terrible things to good people.  We and Sansa are now painfully aware that no one is going to save her.  She is going to have to take the Game into her own hands or continue to be the victim.   I can’t way to see where they take it.

You don't hate a dog for being a dog, you hate the one that trained them. Ramsey is an animal and should be put down, yes, but he's just a reactionary child having his leash yanked by his father. He has games he plays to convince himself he holds power, when he's a whim away from being chained up and forgotten. He knows this. He knows he's a bitch. He knows he's his father's mewling *bitch*.

5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken","The Dorne story line is still the weakest part of this season. The characters are poorly developed and the whole thing feels cheap from the writing to the way its scenes are filmed. Jamie and Bronn just stroll into the Water Gardens with no trouble at all and so do the Sandsnakes at the the exact same moment... Then they have a very poorly choreographed and filmed fight scene, that in the end is completely pointless because everyone is captured. 
Dorne itself is poorly realized, all we see is one long beach that looks like New England. Dorne is supposed to be hot and semi-arid. They film in Spain, why not just use the Spanish countryside?  

I thought the rest of the episode was written and filmed very well and the quality of this season is rising. I was glad to see Baelish back in action in King's Landing, and the Queen of thorns. The Sansa scene though was...gratuitous. There was no reason for her to be raped and there was no reason that Ramsay couldn't have just had consensual sex with her. The scene served no purpose, we already know how horrible Ramsay is. Psychopaths often can compartmentalize and be quite kind and normal in many areas of their lives. It would have been more interesting if he showed kindness to Sansa at first but then began to terrorize her in more subtle ways. "

5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken","They ruined Dorne. Those awful actors (sand snakes) ugh, can't even get the accent right. SoOo disappointed. Only cool thing is the yellow robes. Next season they'll fix this shit because so far the negative reception is the biggest it's ever been."

5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",I half expected theon to stab Ramsey and heroically save Sansa.
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",Honestly kinda wished Joffrey was back when Tommen let them take Margery.  He wouldn't have let them take her.

5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",When the fabric rips by heart stops.
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",No one wants to discuss it but GOT took a turn for the silly tonight.  Bronn and Jamie in disguise was  goofy and comical and the fact that they arrived at the watergardens at the same time as the sand snakes was ridiculously cheesy.  It was very amateur and felt like a lame action movie from the 80s.  The sand snake fight was also weak.  First scene in 5 seasons that was really lame.
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",That pissed me off more than the Red Wedding and The vipers death combined. 
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken","Is it just me, or are the Sand Snakes just blah? I find them, well, uninspiring."

""Oh for fucks sake"""
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken","1) Portraying Rape Won't Create Rape In Real Life. I know it's easy to be reactionary to something as disturbing as an on-screen rape, especially to victims of rape, but think of it this way: We went for decades before something this violent/sexualized could be on screen, and murder, rape, and war still happened. This scene will not create rapists, anymore than the Red Wedding created murderers and pregnant-woman-stabbers.

2) This show takes place in a Medieval world. Certainly, it's a fantasy world, but it's fairly rooted in history. Like it or not, the idea of a woman's right to choose her husband - hell, most of woman's rights - are fairly modern inventions, (disgustingly enough.) This sort of thing happened ALL the time. It's horrible, but it's realistic.

3) GOT has never been pleasant. Murder, war, baby-killing, incest, overwrought sex scenes, prostitution, etc. Saying that this one scene - which, by comparison, was hardly what I would call ""gratuitous"" in that it showed very little - is the one that will destroy your enjoyment of the show is a strange claim.

4) The show wasn't portraying the rape as a positive thing. It was supposed to be reprehensible. Now, I'm all for arguing that it's too much, specifically for that character. I'm all for arguing that the show is borderline exploitation. But don't act like sexy jazz music or the Benny Hill theme was playing with a laugh track during the scene. It was horrible, and it was played as such."
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken","Well, that was disturbing..."
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",I wanted to yell in rage over that rape scene. Absolutely horrifying
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken","Well, congratulations Game of Thrones. You've managed to traumatize me again. "
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",I want Loras to fuck shit up soooooo bad.

Littlefinger's obsession with her mother extended to her and he was protecting her in his own weird way. Feel like that scene took that from me and now I'm sad :( "")"

5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken","
Good drama but the Tyrells would never put Margaery,  Loras,  and Olenna,  in a single room in King's Landing without a team of fiercely loyal bodyguards.

The show is so far off from the books at this point I really did think Sansa would either just tell Ramsay to F off with the exhibition act or she'd get Theon to kill him.

"
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",sansa getting her hair turned back to red - is that a sign of her losing her confidence/power/status?  
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",20 seconds of screen time and Baelish already dropping serious burns. I'd swear my allegiance to House Baelish any time. Also pitting Cersei against the Boltons. Baelish's got this all planned out I guess.

5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken","I'd just like to remind everyone that Dany's wedding night was also.. well.. rough.. and we all know how that turned out.

Not much chance of that this time though, not with this deliciously evil and twisted son of a bitch."
5,6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken","S5E6: When readers had their knowledge almost entirely eclipsed by the show. Damn.

My quick thoughts:

- ""Oh for fuck's sake."" Bronn, breaking the fourth wall and speaking for the entire viewing audience. 

- Margaery in prison? Didn't see Cersei getting the upper hand like this.

- Fuck Littlefinger. For everything in King's Landing AND Winterfell.

- The House of Black and White's room of masks was fucking amazing. The atmosphere of that setting is incredible, they're knocking it out of the park.

- Areo Hotah is a complete badass. I really wanted him to use that spear. I hope we have a chance to see it.

- And last but not least, a contender for one of the greatest lines since Sallador Saan: ""The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant."" 

Welcome to the show Mr. Eko!"

5,7,The Gift,"Sorry if someone said this below, but Hizdar really stressed how Mereen was clamoring for this fighting pits dealie.  This was supposed to be a time honored and much celebrated tradition.  Why was it boasting the attendance of a middle school tee-ball game?"

5,7,The Gift,The high sparrow is doing what we all wanted to do since season one
5,7,The Gift,"""Oh my"" ~Samwell Tarly

Quote of the year right there."
5,7,The Gift,"Can anyone explain why Littlefinger and Lady Olenna needed to do anything at all to get Cersei locked up? I mean, the High Sparrow had Lancel all along, right? And he'd already confessed his sins, surely.

Is there any chance Littlefinger was actually providing Lady Olenna with some kind of exculpatory witness instead, that will show up next week to bust out Margaery and possibly Loras?"
5,7,The Gift,"I hope this goes to show that just because Sansa was raped, it doesn't devalue her development. Even raped and beaten she was still snarking off to Ramsey about being a bastard. He might have won the battle for now, but he hasn't won the war."
5,7,The Gift,She had the perfect bod. 
5,7,The Gift,Pray for Sansa :(
5,7,The Gift,High Sparrow don't give a FUCK.
5,7,The Gift,Gilly and Sam had the most realistically awkward sex scen in television history. 
5,7,The Gift,"Am I crazy or is that the first time I've heard someone say ""bitch"" in the show? They usually use ""whore"". 
"
5,7,The Gift,My favorite part was when Melisandre starts naming the three kings from the leeches and he cuts her off before she says Balon.
5,7,The Gift,I think the Sand Snakes *acting* is starting to get better...
5,7,The Gift,"Lena Headey really killed it this episode. From her speech to Tommen, to fucking around with Margaery, and the slow relization of how screwed she was once Lancel entered the room. "
5,7,The Gift,"Sam and Gilly sex scene!!! Sam and Gilly sex scene!!! *crickets*

"
5,7,The Gift,"Everyone is forgetting to mention how badass Ghost was tonight! not that he isn't always badass, but Sams still got a friend left in castle black!"
5,7,The Gift,"""It can't get any worse."" - Sansa

Does she realize that she's saying that to a person who went from being an heir to the Iron Islands, to being the heir of a spot in the kennel? The dude willingly and graciously accepts the name *Reek*. I suppose that's really telling of just how horrific her situation is. She's under the impression that it can't get any worse, which goes to show just how little she knows about Ramsay. [It can get worse. It can always get worse.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT4_Fefew78)"
5,7,The Gift,"The way Stannis is portrayed throughout the season as a good man, a good father, hope for the realm and probably only chance for Sansa.. I have a really bad feeling about this.
He's even repeating rob's mistake.. Ignoring good advices."
5,7,The Gift,"I wonder what's happening with Varys. Is he still in the brothel waiting for Tyrion to finish pissing ?
"
5,7,The Gift,So we know which sand snake is the least worst now
5,7,The Gift,Am I crazy or did Myrcella age several years while Sam Jr. is still an infant?

5,7,The Gift,Jamie to return to king's landing in episode 10 and bitch slap the sparrow with his metal hand.
5,7,The Gift,"With his love and mother in prison, I think Tommen's balls are about ready to drop."
5,7,The Gift,"This was by far the best episode of the season. Absolutely no complaints about anything.

Whoever did casting for the High Sparrrow needs some praise. He's absolutely perfect for the role."
5,7,The Gift,"That whole time Cersei was with the high sparrow I held my breathe hoping it would go the way I wanted it. And when Lancel walked out, omg, justice. Though I hope Tommen decides to do away with those fuckers now that his mom is out of the picture. "
5,7,The Gift,"Every time they show tits in the show I hear the Honest Trailers voice in my head ""Boooobs"""
5,7,The Gift,"Love how Cersei and Margaery exchange subtle burns ALL the time. I  laughed so hard when Cersei offered her the Venison-bowl, and she managed to sneak in that: ""I had it for dinner last night"" meaning ""Here have the scraps that slaves normally share, bitch"""

5,7,The Gift,"So, how many *gifts* were there in the episode ?  
Ramsey's ""gift"" to Sansa: the flayed woman.  
Petyr's gift to Olenna: ~~Loras~~ ~~Lancel~~. Oliver !  
Sand Snakes gift to Bronn: the antidote  
Stannis (almost) gift to Mel: his daughter.  
Cersei's gift to Margaery: a bowl of venison.  
Gilly's gift to Sam....;D  
The master's gifts to Jorah and Tyrian: a gold piece each.  
Sam's gift to Jon Snow: the Dragonglass dagger

Any more ?
"
5,7,The Gift,"I was really hoping when the High Sparrow mentioned a man coming to King's Landing with much to tell that we might see dear old Gendry again.

Alas, he rows on forever more."
5,7,The Gift,Why don't the Knight's Watch wear hats? You lose a lot of heat through your head.
5,7,The Gift,There's a first time for everything. Five seasons: one natural death.
5,7,The Gift,"Tought Bronn was done for, didnt considered his ability to charm women being a lifesaver "
5,7,The Gift,"If Reek told Ramsay about the candle in the tower, how did he know about the old woman when Sansa did not share this fact? Was she the only other person to have contact with Sansa? And he said that it didn't take long for her to start talking when he was skinning her, so does that mean Ramsay knows about Brienne? (Even when Sansa doesn't know who it is?) or does he know about the man at the Inn that Brienne spoke to? What information would the old woman have given him? I didn't expect this at all- I thought it more likely for him to get soldiers ready, light the candle without her knowledge and see who showed up. Did I miss something?
"
5,7,The Gift,"The way Tommen got mad and screamed ""i am the king"" is very joffrey. He is nothing like his older brother, thank god, but is could be foreshadowing to what could happen soon if Margaery isn't freed. However, the way he's acting could be from involuntary influence on Margaery's behalf. She pushes him to be a strong, demanding king. Who was a demanding king that Tommen saw pre-his becoming? Joffrey and his ""father"" Robert. Tommen has potential to be a great king in Westeros. The love his mother has is holding him back as the manipulation of Margaery is pushing him forward against Cersei's wishes. Tommen's in a screwed up situation, nothing like what his mother and wife are in, but he has to make some pretty big decisions soon and without their counsel. "
5,7,The Gift,"So, no cock merchant then?"
5,7,The Gift,"""The Gift"" was the ending

Taste the Revenge Rainbow Queen Cersei: The Mad Bitch Queen. 

Cersie.exe has stopped working."
5,7,The Gift,"Dude. Tyene Sand has some god-tier titties omg. The Snakes were pretty shit since the beginning of the season, but DAMN! That was one sweet moment of redemption. "
5,7,The Gift,It's not a phase ~~dad~~ uncle this is who I really am.
5,7,The Gift,"Two things didn't make any sense for me in this episode:

1. So, only free men are supposed to fight in the fighting pits, but we can only see slaves fighting there. 

2. As much as I loved to see Cersei locked up, I can't imagine her leaving the castle without a few golden cloaks protecting her."
5,7,The Gift,Tommen was channeling a bit of his older brother's rage for a minute there. It was nice.
5,7,The Gift,"Seven Hells, if that fucking red-haired titty bitch Mellisandre so much as breathes in the direction of my little flower Shireen, I will jump through my TV and rip her damn FACE off!!"
5,7,The Gift,"From a cinematic point of view, the fact that there was a scene where Sam explicitly gave Jon some Dragonglass blades means Jon will probably have to use it later on. If he wasn't going to use one, then they wouldn't show us him being given it surely?

Jon Snow vs White Walker. Calling it now."
5,7,The Gift,"Loved the old people talk between Olenna and the High Sparrow: ""My knees are killing me! My hips are the worst!"""
5,7,The Gift,More silly and pointless scenes in Dorne. I don't know why they bothered adding a new setting and cast if they weren't going to spend enough time to properly develop them. This week they gave us two quick scenes with almost no context. Jamie has a 80's sitcom quarrel with his niece/secret daughter and we see some Sandsnake mammaries. Where's Doran Martel? He's had about 2 minutes of screen time so far.   
5,7,The Gift,"#Ya dun fucked up, Cercei."
5,7,The Gift,"Did anyone else feel as though Danny should be desensitized to violence by now...she lived amongst the Dothraki (killed during thier celebrations etc.), she had been conquering with her army, and even watched the crucifixion of the old masters in meereen.

5,7,The Gift,"**Book/Show Departures**

I WILL be deliberately leaving out specific information for certain points for fear of future spoilers, so please do not correct me in those areas if you notice them. ALl spoilers tagged S5E7 or earlier should be safe for show-only viewers. All others you read at your own risk.

* There's a lot of snake imagery involved with Dorne this season, which I've only just noticed due to the focus on the snake in the new Sunspear opening titles graphic. It might lead some viewers to believe a snake is the emblem of House Martell. It's actually a sun pierced by a spear. Their house words were the title of last week's episode - ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.""
* [S5E7/ADWD](#b ""Jon and Tormund"") both never leave [S5E7/ADWD](#b ""the Wall"") throughout ADWD. [S5E7/AFFC](#b ""Jon sends a bunch of Stannis's ships and wildlings to Hardhome, with no POV character to accompany them."")
* In the books, there's a subplot involving two babies and ""king's blood"" - [S4E9/ASOS](#b ""Mance Rayder has a wife in the books, who dies giving birth to his son the day Stannis arrives at the Wall and defeats his army."") [S5E7/ADWD](#b ""Jon fears Melisandre intends to burn Mance's son as a sacrifice after having burned the man himself; he thus switches out the baby with Gilly's boy and sends the pair far away from the Wall."")
* Fuck this new Winterfell plotline so hard.
* [S5E7/AFFC](#b ""Maester Aemon accompanies Gilly for the same reasons as the baby switcheroo, since he's a Targaryen. He does indeed die while they sail south and is buried at sea, the showrunners didn't just drop a bridge on him."")
* The Stormcrows sellsword company is at Meereen in the books
* The usurper, Balon who?
* [S5E7/AFFC](#b ""Gilly does sleep with Sam in the books around this point. However, it's heavily implied that she actually RAPES him, pretty much ambushing him while he's sleeping - he really doesn't want to break his vows in the books."")
* IIRC in the books the slave stuff plays out mirrored - [S5E7/ADWD](#b ""Jorah is nigh suicidal and very disheveled/malnourished; Tyrion is bought to become part of a 'grotesquerie'(sic?) and convinces his new master to buy Jorah as well."")
* [S5E7/ADWD](#b ""In the books, Daario suggests that Dany massacre the Meereenese nobles at her *wedding* rather than the opening of the pits, in an ironic parallel to the Red Wedding."")
* I really enjoyed the [S5E7](#s ""High Sparrow's scene with Olenna, which didn't happen in the books (Olenna is still at Highgarden in the books)."") It brought to mind once again Varys's season 2 riddle about power.
* Time is even more vague in this show than in the books. In the books ~2 years pass between the start of AGOT and the end of AFFC/ADWD. Remember that Myrcella left for Dorne mid-season 2. Now she says Dorne has been her home for ""years."" How much times has passed???
* I yet again don't understand the point of the scene with the Sand Snakes beyond gratuitous nudity. The only significant plot point that happened was [S5E7](#s ""Bronn getting his antidote."") Which didn't need to happen in the first place.
* Okay, the Meereenese situation in the books is a million times more complicated. I'll try to sum it up as briefly as possible. However, since the following plotline hasn't yet been 100% guaranteed cut from the show, I'll be labeling it as ""Potential Future Spoilers,"" so proceed at your own risk. [ADWD/Potential Future Spoilers](#b ""In the books, the slavers of Yunkai'i (the city she spared in season 3) restart the slave trade shortly after Dany settles in Meereen. They immediately start building alliances with the many powers that are very unhappy about the whole 'ending the very profitable slave trade' business. Eventually they march on Astapor, crush that city, and then march on Meereen. They lay siege to Meereen. In order to appease both the Sons of the Harpy and the besieging slavers, Dany marries Hizdahr, agrees to re-open the fighting pits in Meereen, and agrees to allow Yunkai'i and Astapor to re-open their slave trade without interference. This is about where the show has reached in that plotline, so I'll stop there."")
* In the books, [S5E7/ADWD](#b ""they really are volunteer fighters in the Pits - Hizdahr actually brings some to testify to Dany in order to help in his campaign to have them re-opened. I don't know why they made them actual slave fighters again other than to get Jorah and Tyrion into Meereen."") Also, why the fuck would a slaveowner stay *in a pit with armed, unbound slaves?*
* [ADWD/Potential Future Spoilers](#b ""The aforementioned Yunkish siege of Meereen actually prevents Jorah and Tyrion from actually entering the city. Thus, Dany and Tyrion have yet to actually meet in the books."")
* [S5E7/AFFC](#b ""Cersei's downfall"") has this same end but through different means in the books. [S5E7/AFFC](#b ""In the books, there are a trio of minor characters known as the Kettleblack brothers - Osney, Osmund, and Osfryd - who are basically some of Cersei's paid thugs. In AFFC, Cersei orchestrates Margaery's downfall by torturing false confessions of adultery out of several male courtiers frequently seen in her company. She sends Osney Kettleblack to confess as well, promising to sleep with him if he does. This backfires completely because Osney *totally* breaks down under torture, and confesses that he was sleeping with *Cersei* as well. Thing is, Cersei is much more screwed (heh) than Margaery, because she has for certain been having numerous affairs with male (and female) courtiers. So when she marches into Baelor's Sept to see Margaery as she does in the show...she too gets thrown in the dungeons."")

Better episode than last week. Still hate the Winterfell plot with a passion."
5,7,The Gift,"Can anyone else say ""Dornish ex machina?"""
5,7,The Gift,Can we just take a second to appreciate how nice the rack on that sandsnake was? I know it may seem obvious but they were some PERFECT knockers....
5,7,The Gift,"this was my favorite of the season so far! 

I especially loved the shot when Reek was climbing the stairs of Winterfell. and damn, Lancel. "
5,7,The Gift,"God damn it, Theon!"
5,7,The Gift,Nobody expects the Sparrow Inquisition!
5,7,The Gift,"Damn, Tommen went full Joffrey for a minute there."
5,7,The Gift,Even the Sand Snakes didn't suck this episode. Nice...
5,7,The Gift,"Whoa, this episode had everything:

Tyrion meets Dany

Dany and Jorah reunited

Tommen ALMOST grew a pair

Ghost returns!

Gendry gets acknowledged

Cersei finally gets comeuppence

Sam's epic line about ""I killed a white walker, I killed a thenn...""


Really the only thing that I didn't like is how it seems that Olenna is slipping up and making the same rash threats that a lesser player would do.  She isn't coming across the same way she used to at this point.
"
5,7,The Gift,That guy's nod after freeing Tyrion was Bronn level broness
5,7,The Gift,That Cersei v Tommen speech was quite emotional. I actually thought she was going to backflip because of Tommens pain. Sadly.... She doesn't really give a fuck.  
5,7,The Gift,What kind of paperwork was Ramsey doing when Theon/Reek came in? Taxes? Payroll? I don't get why he needs an office when he's mostly about the flaying and torturing.
5,7,The Gift,I just want to say that holy shit was Master Aemon well acted.  That guy owned every scene he was in.
5,7,The Gift,Poor Maester Aemon....  I'll miss him.
5,7,The Gift,Why does danny look disgusted at the fighting pits? She's had men burnt alive in front of her.
5,7,The Gift,"So, different gifts in this ep:

- Ramsay gifting Sansa with the dead body of her former confidant (Happy First Day of Winter, sweetheart *kiss*)

- LF gifting Olenna with inside info on Cersei

- Jorah gifting Dany with Tyrion

- Gilly gifting Sam with some sex

- Sam gifting Jon with the dragonglass dagger

- Tyene (?) gifting Bronn with his life, and the audience with some prime tit visuals

- Melisandre trying to get Stannis to gift Shireen to R'hllor

what else?

On another note man is Sansa an idiot, baiting Ramsay like that about him being a bastard. On the other hand, I liked the little motivational speech she gave to Theon. She's definitely changed, is changing, and will end up changing him, too. And what news did Olenna get from ~~the wall? From whom?~~  Littlefinger? Is the handsome young man really Lancel?

Edit: Littlefinger, not the Wall
"
5,7,The Gift,"Olenna and Littlefinger are my two favourite characters, that scene was marvelous"
5,7,The Gift,"tommen should just murder the faith millitant. the idea that the lower classes give a shit about the religion is awfully idiotic. 

they don't particularly care for the faith millitant. they look scared whenever we see the faith out in the streets. the populace loves whoever gives them food and entertainment. they love queen margaery and the tyrells for bringing them food. the people should be revolting against the faith because they're going to lose their free food.

writers have this backwards. "
5,7,The Gift,what will happen if Roose and Walda name their son Michael?
5,7,The Gift,Jorah kinda had an unfair advantage in that fight by starting late...
5,7,The Gift,Ghost doesn't get enough screen time :(
5,7,The Gift,"[This is for you, Cersei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX7wtNOkuHo)

5,7,The Gift,"Bronn lives!! Yay!

"
5,7,The Gift,"Now THIS is the GoT I'm used to. Sam getting some booty! J Bear making it to Dany! Ghost making an appearance! Bronn getting that antidote! Cersei getting locked up! R.I.P Maester Aemon and god damnit, Reek! I thought he was breaking through..."
5,7,The Gift,All those bruises on Sansas arm.... Right in the feels. *____*
5,7,The Gift,"SOO much happened this episode, I can't even keep track after only one watch-through

1. Sam slaying something else this time

2. Sand boobs

3. Yay, Bronn lives to see another day, but will probably die soon anyway

4. RIP to one of the last Targaryens. Always was one of my favorite characters. 

5. Lady Olenna stay schemin

6. TYRION & DANY ARE FINALLY TOGETHER! I feel like this really isn't getting enough attention on this thread. The merging of these storylines is going to be unreal. 

7. Sucks to suck Cersei, hopefully solitary suits you well

8. Ramsay may be the devil incarnate, but at least he is fascinating in his own evil way. I hate everything he does, but I also kind of look forward to his next scene. Joffrey was just an annoying little pussy. 

9. Stannis will be getting a ""World's #1 Dad"" mug this fathers day.

Edit: 10. That little kid that has been the steward for Jon really makes me nervous"
5,7,The Gift,Waiting for next Sunday: http://i.imgur.com/6440yRM.gif?1
5,7,The Gift,Cersei's dog has turned on her and bit her hard.
5,7,The Gift,There were a bunch of great scenes in this episode. I really enjoyed every scene with Lady Olenna and every scene with the High Sparrow.
5,7,The Gift,Hopefully this will lead to a Cersei vs Margery trial by combat.
5,7,The Gift,"Love every scene with the Queen of Thorns. She's gotten pwned last 2 episodes, but you can only keep a good woman down for so long (I hope). "
5,7,The Gift,"Bronn doesn't die, Sam gets laid, and Cersei gets thrown in jail. Wtf HBO I don't want this happy shit."
5,7,The Gift,"Wasn't fucking with the Deus Ex Machina Ghost appearance, but I fucked with everything else in this episode. It has everything, and it was well balanced.

Tyrion and Khaleesi meeting was so fucking satisfying.

Fuck you Cersei."
5,7,The Gift,Brienne standing out in the snow like that. In armor. Must be freezing...
5,7,The Gift,[deleted]
5,7,The Gift,seriously cersei you didn't have to think that far ahead to suspect what would happen.
5,7,The Gift,"Stannis with a full beard, lookin' good. "
5,7,The Gift,I'm hoping the High Sparrow gets his hands on Ramsay next.
5,7,The Gift,"I was cheering out loud alone in my room at the end of this. The whole thing was great, even the Sand Snakes were pretty okay this time.

One thing that stood out to me was they referred to the leeches, Robb Stark and Joffrey Baratheon, but no mention of Balon Greyjoy. I would have thought that would be a perfect time for Stannis to throw that one in her face as part of the reason to tell her to GTFO. But they just didn't mention it. Makes me worry that they might actually never revisit that plot. Come to think of it, Gemma Whalen was supposed to return as Yara according to IMDB and confirmed by her agency, and yet she didn't appear. Hmph."
5,7,The Gift,People are neglecting to mention the best part of this episode - Bronn's not dead! :D
5,7,The Gift,[deleted]
5,7,The Gift,Someone needs to stab all these crazy mofos walkin around with head tattoos and bathrobes.
5,7,The Gift,How about my dude Samwell finally gettin it in!?!?
5,7,The Gift,Damn it Reek! Where are your balls? Oh...
5,7,The Gift,"Anyone else getting hints of the Iconoclasm movement in the Byzantine Empire from the Sparrow's beliefs?
"
5,7,The Gift,"I feel like a lot of people have over looked this, but Cersei wasn't just fucking Lancel.. She also had him give Robert Baratheon poisoned wine.
That being said, I don't see Tommen standing by while his mom and wife are in jail.. waiting a trial to reveal incest murder and false kings."
5,7,The Gift,"I really want to see more Arya and the Faceless man. It seems like that story is going teasingly slow.
"
5,7,The Gift,If Tommen was a stronger king he could just pull a Henry VIII and create his own new church because he doesn't like the current one...
5,7,The Gift,"So, someone can kill of Ramsay now. Thanks.

Also, please leave Bronn alone."
5,7,The Gift,"""Look at this face. It'll be the last thing you see before you die.""

""Lol doubt it."" *shuts door*"
5,7,The Gift,"""He slayed the great Khal drogooo in single combat"" haha! talk about a sales pitch"
5,7,The Gift,"WHEN AEMON WAS TALKING ABOUT AEGON AND PLAYING WITH GILLY'S SON ;-; too sad. Even if he is a hundred or so years old, too sad."
5,7,The Gift,"I've tasted the Dornishman's wiiiiife

Bronn slaying it with his singing once again. "
5,7,The Gift,"[ALL BOOKS](#b ""and I'm sitting here wondering where the fuck Manderly is"")"
5,7,The Gift,"Did anyone think that dornish chick started sexually teasing Bronn so he can his heartbeat to increase to allow increased blood flow, thereby speeding the effect of the poison

It's little things like this that makes the show interesting"
5,7,The Gift,"I liked how it showed Theon climbing the tower with the candle, cuts to the tower from outside, then cuts to Theon opening the door seeing Ramsey, then the next scene it shows just a candle burning, then the focus shifts towards the back showing we are now at Castle Black"
5,7,The Gift,"I don't know what it is, but I kind of like the Sand Snakes now."
5,7,The Gift,"""By the way I poisoned you.""

""K.""

""And I have the only antidote.""

""Gimme.""

""First, tell me I'm pretty.""

""K.""

""Okay, here you go.""

Seriously what the fuck was the point of any of that? "
5,7,The Gift,Cersei just got 360noscoped. 
5,7,The Gift,"Oh hai Joffrey 2.0. Good to see you.

Also: ""Any man who has to say 'I am the king' is no true king."""
5,7,The Gift,"Okay, **one** we need a flair for Ghost

**two** That was a lovely SandSnake rack.

**three** Ser Friendzone was pretty badass."
5,7,The Gift,This is the first time Dany met a main character from Westeros storylines. 
5,7,The Gift,"After all the controversy of recent weeks, Gilly made extra sure to get consent first."
5,7,The Gift,This episode was a roller coaster of emotions from Bronn almost dying to Cersei getting what's due. THE HIGH SPARROW SHOWS NO MERCY.
5,7,The Gift,And that's what happens when you make bad decisions all your life. Toodles Cersi
5,7,The Gift,"Overall, that was a really entertaining episode. Fuck Cersei, and Ghost was a badass per usual "
5,7,The Gift,Fuck yeah! She had that smug attitude all these episodes and finally shes got it coming!
5,7,The Gift,"Not enough Jon Snow in this episode or last, next episode hype though."
5,7,The Gift,Tommen gonna be mad and do.... absolutely sweet fuck all.
5,7,The Gift,"When Bron was given that cure for the poison, so much anxiety left me."
5,7,The Gift,"Did anyone else hear a bit of Joffrey in Tommens voice when he was angry? Especially the ""I am the king!"" Part.
"
5,7,The Gift,Benioff said in the post-episode analysis-thing that the death of Maester Aemon was the first natural death in the series. What about Hoster Tully (Catelyn's father)?
5,7,The Gift,"Did Ramsay happen to be in the broken tower, or was the show pretending to show him going there, and Theon really went straight to Ramsay and ratted out Sansa? Also, if that is true, I am officially SEETHING"
5,7,The Gift,Jorah is Maximus.  I love it.
5,7,The Gift,I'm so hyped for some Tyrion and Daenerys scenes next episode.
5,7,The Gift,"[Cersei's face](http://i.imgur.com/3JBfBST.png) when the High Sparrow says ""What will we find when we strip away your finery?""

*Priceless.* "
5,7,The Gift,This episode was like coke. so much build up leaving us wanting more
5,7,The Gift,"That wonderful moment when Cersei is talking to the High Sparrow and you can pinpoint the exact second she first thinks ""wait what'"
5,7,The Gift,Big balls Baelish moving all the chess pieces.  
5,7,The Gift,My body is ready for a Tyrion and Dany romance.
5,7,The Gift,"all right. Loras and Margeary get found guilty because they are guilty. the punishment is 100 hours of community service. Cersei is found guilty because she is guilty. the punishment is death for her, an uncoronation for Tommen, and the death of House Lannister's legacy."
5,7,The Gift,The episode was shocking. Someone actually died of natural causes.
5,7,The Gift,"How was Sansa's relationship with Jon? When she learned he became lord of the nights watch she was surprised for sure, but is she proud? Did she see him as a way out? "
5,7,The Gift,"Ever since Ramsey said ""Come, my lady"", [this](https://youtu.be/IKzX5zRdsq0) has been playing in my head. Bothered me throughout the episode.

Especially when Jorah met Dany. I was totally picturing him singing this song for her."
5,7,The Gift,"You know what, I like Myrcella. She was very straight forward and commanding. You don't know me, I like it here, fuck off. Sucks for Jaime, but I respect her. "
5,7,The Gift,"Anybody noticed littlefinger's scene had ""Chaos is a ladder"" background music in it. It certainly is a chaos.

Now Jamie is going to know about Lancel and cersi.Oh..this is a good plotline this season. Now the war is who will kill cersi first."

also, Jorah's Exile v2: Electric Boogaloo"

5,8,Hardhome,Gendry has the right idea. Just stay on a boat... forever.

5,8,Hardhome,"As someone who is only halfway through A Clash of Kings, I have to say that the ending of this episode *really* gave me a much needed reality check on how much of a threat the White Walkers are. Holy **fucking** shit. Honestly, the last 15 minutes of this episode were horrifying."

5,8,Hardhome,"So everyone is correctly stoked about that last megascene but:

Tyrion+Dany totally lived up to everything I wanted it to be. He was witty and insightful, she was strong and resolute. Everything both of them said was absolutely fantastic.

5,8,Hardhome,"If it were me in that rowboat at the end, I'd be rowing with much more urgency."

5,8,Hardhome,Top 3 episode all time. No question. 
5,8,Hardhome,"Cersei continues to kill it with the acting. Sad no Margery or other KL scene. 

That battle might just be one of my favourite sequences from the show ever. And that poor wildling woman, I liked her. I was just thinking how she had the potential to become one of my favourites and then dead. God dammit Game of Thrones. "
5,8,Hardhome,That ending. I've got fucking chills. Hell that last 15-20 minutes. Wow.
5,8,Hardhome,"Oh my god that episode had everything. That was amazing. In one hour we got to see:

1. Arya being a spy/assassin. 
2. Cersei pulled off her high horse. 
3. Tormund being a badass.
4. Wight zombie movie invasion. The suspense before the attack was amazing. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat.
5. Jon Snow killing a White Walker. Valeryn Steel = Dragon Glass?
6. White Walker King raising the dead.
7. Sansa finds out that Bran & Rickon are still alive!
8. Tyrion vs. Daenerys. 
9. Jorah being Jorah.
"
5,8,Hardhome,"Remind me when Tormund asks me to buy a hotel room, I better fucking do it.

Edit: I shall use the gold to save up for a Tormund approved hotel room. Thanks!!"
5,8,Hardhome,"Holy shit I thought it was just an avalanche, I have never been so wrong in all my life."
5,8,Hardhome,"The *GRAVITY* of the ""Winter is coming"" really hit me when the undead army stopped at the water..... I realized when that water freezes over, the 'realm of men' is gonna have to get it together."

5,8,Hardhome,That final staredown holy shit man.
5,8,Hardhome,"What the fuck is Episode 9 going to do now?

Also, did anyone else notice Reek referring to himself as ""I"", and not ""Theon"", when talking about Theon not killing Bran and Rickon?"
5,8,Hardhome,"1. Varyrian Steel + Dragonglass both confirmed OP against WW

5,8,Hardhome,"I know we're all jizzing over the last 30 minutes, but Sansa's part was very satisfying. She knows Brann and Rickon are alive and she's breaking Reek back into Theon. Top 5 episode easily"

Then he'll get his arm and hand burned the fuck up by dragonfire effectively curing him of Greyscale and taking Victarion's place in the process.

5,8,Hardhome,"Did anyone else notice how much attention was put on Wun Wun the giant as he was making his way into the water towards the boat.

5,8,Hardhome,I really hope Gendry doesn't end up rowing to Hardhome.
5,8,Hardhome,"This episode was masterful. They've never structured an episode like this before; they've had episodes that took place in one location, and as we all know most episodes take place in 3-6 locations and we jump around a lot. This is how the first half hour was structured. Then we get to Jon's storyline, and the fact that the next half hour of the show is going to be a massive slaughter at Hardhome is completely unbeknownst to us. At a certain point, you realize that the heroes aren't just going to escape and the show just isn't going to cut somewhere else. I was completely convinced Jon was going to die.

Amazing."
5,8,Hardhome,"Best episode of the season so far, and also the episode that spends the least amount of time paying attention to what's happening in Dorne.  Funny how that worked out."

This isn't your standard zombie horde.

It's not even your standard high fantasy undead army.  or rather it is, but one that's usually being driven by a freakin' lich.

I want to know WTF is driving them.  It's not malice or some primal impulse.  The rank and file is intelligent.  But more importantly, that last bit there showed their leader understands dramatic effect, and has a flair for showmanship. 

This... is very disturbing.  There's a malevolent intelligence at the heart of this thing, and I want to know what it wants, as well as why."

5,8,Hardhome,"**Book/Show Departures**

Spoilers marked S5E8 or earlier should be safe for show-only viewers. All others spoilers AT YOUR OWN RISK. Divergences are mixed in with my own personal comments. Also, at certain points I am DELIBERATELY leaving certain book information out, so consider that before filling my inbox with corrections of that nature.

* Since [S5E7](#s ""Tyrion"") met up with [S5E7](#s ""Dany"") last episode, which has yet to happen in the books, I'll preface this post by recapping the major show storylines that have either mostly or completely diverged (or exceeded, in the former character's case) from their book counterparts: [S5E8/AFFC/ADWD](#b ""Sansa, Brienne, Tyrion, Jaime, Samwell (so far), and Davos (so far)"") along with innumerable non-POV/minor characters. Book POV storylines that have been cut completely are [AFFC/ADWD](#b ""Arys/Arianne, Quentyn, the Greyjoys, and Barristan."")
* Still really vague on how much time has passed in-universe. Surprised it's been ""a few years"" since Dany was married off to Drogo, since it doesn't feel that long at all.
* To be honest I feel [S5E8](#s ""Tyrion advising re-exiling Jorah"") is out of character for him. [S5E8](#s ""Tyrion"") is above all Machiavellian in his methods (at least in the books - they did make him more overtly moral in the show), and would use [S5E8](#s ""Jorah"") as an expendable tool rather than getting rid of him.
* IIRC Arya's ""oyster-selling orphan"" persona in the books was called ""Cat of the Canals."" I don't really know why they changed that.
* PLOT HOLE ALERT: [S3/ACOK](#s ""In the show, (S3E1 I believe) it was explicitly noted by Catelyn Stark that Theon was suspected to have disappeared with the two younger Stark boys to the Iron Islands, NOT that he murdered them. The ironborn killed the entire raven population of Winterfell to keep the 'murder' of the Stark boys a secret. In the books, it was widely known that the Stark boys were 'dead.' So there's no reason for Sansa to accuse Theon of murdering her brothers, and by extension no reason for Theon's confession to be much of a shock."")
* Ramsay's ""20 good men"" line seems to me like a dark call back to Theon's exploits in ACOK/S2.
* ""Someday I'll tell you why I killed my father"" = author's saving throw for cutting [ASOS](#b ""'Wherever whores go.'"")
* In the books, [ASOS](#b ""Tyrion swore to kill Jaime the next time he saw him, due to Jaime's role concerning Tysha."") He doesn't trust him one inch.
* I really enjoy this ""spokes on a wheel"" conversation, considering I'm firmly in [S5E8](#s ""Tyrion's"") camp of cynicism in that regard.
* Events at [S5E8/ADWD](#s ""Hardhome"") take place entirely ""off-screen"" in the books. [S5E8/ADWD](#b ""Jon sends Cotter Pyke, commander at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, to evacuate the settlement by sea. At the end of ADWD, he receives a letter from Pyke claiming that there are 'dead things' in the forest and water, that slavers have visited the camp and taken many wildlings, and that his ships have been attacked by refugees but those attacks have been beaten back; he needs a ranging by land to conduct a proper evacuation. Jon resolves to lead that ranging with Tormund."") Obviously, this means none of Jon's stuff in this episode happens in the books.
* [ASOS/S5E8](#s ""Rattleshirt"") is actually the leader of the Wildling raiders that attack the Wall in S4E8 in the books, not Tormund. [ASOS/S4E8](#b ""He is captured after that battle like Tormund was in the show."") [ADWD](#b ""Rattleshirt is burned by Melisandre in Mance Rayder's place. He is given Melisandre's glamor magic to appear as Mance in order to pull off this deception."") [Speculation](#g ""I'm frustrated they just wrote him out here in the show. IMO it for certain puts Mance dead as a doornail."")
* The negotiations at [S5E8](#s ""Hardhome"") have serious vibes of [ADWD/S5E8](#b ""Jon's negotiations with Tormund and his wildling army remnant"") from the books.
* Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun cameo hype?! CONFIRMED.
* [S5E8](#s ""Dunno why a wooden palisade is halting ice zombie magic, but eh."")
* PLOT HOLE ALERT: Jon Snow should know that [AGOT/S1](#s ""fire can kill wights. Further plot holes appear to ensue as normal steel and arrows kill wights."")
* I actually do like the [S5E8](#s ""White Walker shattering Sigorn's (the Thenn leader) weapon."") It's actually a call back to the prologue of AGOT, where [AGOT/S5E8](#b ""a White Walker shatters Ser Waymar Royce's sword in order to end their duel."")
* BOOK THEORY CONFIRMED: [Speculation/S5E8](#g ""Valyrian Steel can fucking kill White Walkers!"")
* So that whole battle sequence was pretty awesome for book-readers.

See you next week."

Today my rapist's treacherous tortured dog let slip my brothers might be alive. So I got that going for me, which is nice."
5,8,Hardhome,holy fucking shit that's the episode we've been waiting for
5,8,Hardhome,Someone should do a wordle of this post and the top 3 words will be HOLY FUCKING SHIT
5,8,Hardhome,"THAT ENDING THOUGH. EEEEEEE. 

Also, DAMMIT. That woman earned my admiration within the first 5 minutes of her screentime. ""So would mine but fuck em they're dead"" - HELL YEA. 

Andddd 10 minutes later she's sporting bright blue eyes. DAMMIT!"
5,8,Hardhome,"Row, row, row your motherfucking boat for fuck sake"
5,8,Hardhome,"When the wildling woman that we had only met this episode put her two young daughters on the boat with the classic, ""I'll be right behind you"" line, I figured something bad was about to happen. What I didn't expect was what ended up being the most visually impressive and heart rate raising scene I've ever watched on GoT's. As other's have said, this was an amazing way to demonstrate just how ridiculous and frightening the White Walkers can be, and with the WW King raising all of the fallen and bolstering his ranks even more...I mean, what the actual fuck are they going to do too stop that?"
5,8,Hardhome,Wun Wun is a strong independent Giant who don't need no rowboat
5,8,Hardhome,You know it's been an amazing episode when nobody mentions Theon's revelation about Bran and Rickon.
5,8,Hardhome,Jorah only buys his clothes at Jorah Outfitters.  Same goddam yellow shirt and khakis he was wearing the first time he got exiled.
5,8,Hardhome,I've realized that Cerci is Jeb Bush. She's been living off the fame of her brother and father for most of her life and can't seem to understand that arming religious extremists could backfire... 
5,8,Hardhome,Holy shit I thought Jon was gonna die
5,8,Hardhome,"Fuck with Jon, get turned to diamond dust! "
5,8,Hardhome,Holy shit I haven't jumped up and yelled at this show since the Red Wedding! That was awesome!!!
5,8,Hardhome,Westeros is so fucked. 
5,8,Hardhome,"Is anyone gonna talk about Ramsay saying ""a feast for the crows"" "
5,8,Hardhome,This episode is meant to be watched in IMAX. 
5,8,Hardhome,Am I crazy or was one of the undead children the undead girl from the opening scene in the pilot?
5,8,Hardhome,"White walker: I have an army

Jon: We have a Wun Wun"
5,8,Hardhome,Im so pumped for the Danny and Tyrion storyline! Their dialogue was so enjoyable.
5,8,Hardhome,"Boy, do I feel sorry for everyone who stopped watching after Episode 6."
5,8,Hardhome,">*I'm not going to stop the wheel I'm going to break the wheel*

Ever since I saw the first promo with this line it has bothered me so much!!!

You are the fucking mother of dragons!! Burn!!! You are going to **burn** the wheel!!!"
5,8,Hardhome,I bet arya uses the poison Meryn Trant
5,8,Hardhome,"Things are looking up! 

- Just when Sansa was about to give up, she is given hope from the unlikeliest of places. Now time to get plotting and dole out some justice.

- Tyrion has the inside info that gives Dany the edge she needs to become queen of the world. The talent is rising to the top. More justice.

- Arya is officially about to become an assassin for the Lord. In the name of Justice!

- Cersei is sucking up floor water! Justice!

Oh, wait. This is GoT. Hope doesn't come without a price.

- Ramsey is after Stannis 
- White Walkers are after everyone

"
5,8,Hardhome,"*raises all of the dead, Looks John Snow in the eyes, winks* ""See you later, babe"" 
"
5,8,Hardhome,"I haven't read the books, so I could be way off base here, but from the look of everything it seems like this is all building up to Daenerys, Jon and maybe Stannis combined forces fighting the undead army with Bran taking control of Drogon, while the best fighters in Westeros armed with Valyrian Steel fuck up the White Walkers."
5,8,Hardhome,"Rewatching and posting late, but Peter Dinklage is so good that it isn't even fair."
5,8,Hardhome,"I thought when the King whitewalker rose his arms he was about to freeze the sea, so they'd come after them"
5,8,Hardhome,"The end of series seems clear now. The White Walkers will be defeated by the Dragons. That's the clash of Ice and Fire, the series is the song of that clash.
The 3 eyed crow told Bran he'd never walk again but that he'd fly. Obviously he's taking over a Dragon and killing the army of the undead with it!
"
5,8,Hardhome,"Well John Snow officially fucked shit up.  White walker king has a rival.
"
5,8,Hardhome,That fucking giant has the heart of a warrior. Looks like there will be a giant behind the wall.
5,8,Hardhome,Jon Snow absolutely bonkered all the white walkers. His face when his valyrian steel sword didnt shatter was amazing. Best fight in the series. Hands down.
5,8,Hardhome,"Hahaha Tormund's ""He's prettier than both my daughters."""
5,8,Hardhome,"Something I haven't seen mentioned yet, and totally caught me off guard: Holy Fucking Fuck Tormund just fucked up Rattleshirt!"
5,8,Hardhome,Half of that episode was Jon eyefucking the camera and I loved it.
5,8,Hardhome,"its' weird.. I really hate cersei.. but I also want her to keep her promise and burn that religous nutjob woman alive..

do I have stockhom's?"
5,8,Hardhome,"Oysters, Clams and Cuckolds!"
5,8,Hardhome,Let's talk about how Tormund bloody beat Rattleshirt to death. 
5,8,Hardhome,"""Jon'll be back.  He always comes back."" - Samwell
Thanks Sam, I love you, but you basically just fucking killed Jon.

Poor badass wildling lady wasn't ready for white walker daycare.

I guess Bran and company stole Gendry's idea."
5,8,Hardhome,"Jon Snow rides in to Hardhome looking badass and confident

He rides out more terrified than he thought possible"
5,8,Hardhome,"Ice King can raise an army of the dead 

But John Snow can raise one of the living"
5,8,Hardhome,"Where is Rick Grimes when you need him, am I right?

CORAL! GET THE DRAGON GLASS!!!"
5,8,Hardhome,"Started to like the woman wildling character

AND.....she's dead




Or should I say undead lol"
5,8,Hardhome,"Tormund and Wun Wun spin-off anyone? 

We could call it Tormund and the giant

Also I don't like it when Tormund cries"
5,8,Hardhome,I was hard that whole episode. 
5,8,Hardhome,White Walkers can't melt Valyrian Steel beams. 
5,8,Hardhome,So....was that the Night's King?
5,8,Hardhome,I think after this episode we can officially start making GOT haunted houses.
5,8,Hardhome,Well that battle was just FUCKING AWESOME!
5,8,Hardhome,[deleted]
5,8,Hardhome,That ending shot showing that army and just the silence honestly said 1000 words. That was fucking amazing.
5,8,Hardhome,I AM SO HAPPY WUN WUN MADE IT. 
5,8,Hardhome,In this week's episode: Game of Thrones becomes a cooler version of the Walking Dead.
5,8,Hardhome,Why did you scroll this far down? The white walkers are down here. Keep quiet or they'll hear us. *OH GOD OH* AHHHHH^HH^H^h
5,8,Hardhome,"Jon at the end: ""We're gonna need a taller wall."""
5,8,Hardhome,"1. Holy shit. What an episode.

2. Dany's plot went from least interesting of the season, right up to the top when Tyrion arrived, only to be bounced down to #2 by the ending to Jon's segment.

3. ""There is another way""... Oh cool, do we finally get to see what ended up happening to the Mountain? ""Will it weaken him?"" ""Oh no my lady..."" Is he going to free Cersei?

4. Can't wait to see what happens with the Sansa/Theon storyline. I think something drastic will happen by the end of the season.

5. The kind pretty lady who got herself wight'd by saying she'd be right behind the children is [Birgitte Hjort Sørensen](http://multimedia.pol.dk/archive/00719/ind_birgitte_05-02-_719947a.jpg), in case anyone else was stricken by her beauty.
"
5,8,Hardhome,"Anyone notice the 3 clear chances the white walker had to stab jon with his ice spear thing but instead threw him around? I can't quite get my head around the logic there, unless he was just up for playing around first. Like my momma used to say ""don't play with your food""."
5,8,Hardhome,Tormund's negotiating skills are enviable.  
5,8,Hardhome,"At first I thought it was poor storytelling that no one does anything while the Lord of Bones is murdered, but then I realized that he was probably a 24/7 asshole to everyone."
5,8,Hardhome,How long before little finger is conniving with the WW?
5,8,Hardhome,Winter is coming because that battle gave me chills. 
5,8,Hardhome,WINTER IS COMING

5,8,Hardhome,I really thought they destroyed Longclaw for a second there...
5,8,Hardhome,Whitewalker at the end might as well have been The Undertaker. 
5,8,Hardhome,"Oh mah gawd, that episode is just awesome. I can only imagine how the final confrontation between the White Walkers and the rest of Westeros will turn out. Anyone else has a feeling that the white walkers are gonna bring the Wall crashing down?

Also Danny needs to bring those dragons over ASAP."
5,8,Hardhome,everybody agrees on their love for tormund <3
5,8,Hardhome,"Dany and Tyrion...

Weirdest job interview ever?"
5,8,Hardhome,"Birgitte Hjort Sørensen, your three minutes of screen time will not soon be forgotten."
5,8,Hardhome,"Those last few moments when Jon was running to the boats were so intense. ""Fuck the glass, we're going to die here! """
5,8,Hardhome,Whoever the poor soul is who had the job of being the last fucking rower.... major props to them. The fucking icy apocalypse is going on and you're like ya ill give it 5 more minutes until Snow comes out here and gets on my boat.

Kind of glad jon snow got on the slowest moving boat in history.      
Dat uncomfortable eye contact"
5,8,Hardhome,"i don't know about you guys, but the way those wildlings suddenly stopped pushing against the wall and screaming when the fog came was just *chilling*. And those kids... sounds like the white walkers know a thing or two about psychological warfare. o_O

Jon's face at the end is essentially symbolizes what the entire audience is feeling after this episode. Excuse me as I go ponder the futility of my love for GoT now."
5,8,Hardhome,The four White Walkers of the apocalypse!
5,8,Hardhome,First time since the beginning of the show that I actually wanted to know about Bran. 
5,8,Hardhome,The final two episodes already? God dammit
5,8,Hardhome,"Things I loved about this episode:

* Sansa telling Reek/Theon that she would do to him what Ramsay did if she could.
* Sansa finding out that Theon did not kill her brothers.
* The banter between Tyrion and Daenerys. I think I'm going to like Tyrion advising her. This is gonna be good (while it lasts).
* Arya becoming someone else.
* That conversation between Ollie and Sam. ""Sometimes, a man has to make hard choices. Choices that might look wrong but you know are right."" You could see the gears working in the kid's head. 
* The giant squashing the wight skeletons like bugs. 
* Jon fighting the white walker... Regular steel shatters. Valyrian steel makes white walker confetti!
* The whole fight scene at Hardhome.

My neighbours down the hall must have heard me yelling at the TV and they probably think I'm insane. Cheering and yelling and laughing (come on, the giant stomping was funny)... 

Best episode this season by far."
5,8,Hardhome,"and the Night's King makes his intentions known.

Jon is all like, ""hide yo chilren, hide yo wife, they're stabbin erryone round hur."""
5,8,Hardhome,"Thanks Wun-Wun, MVP"
5,8,Hardhome,Valerian steel ain't nothin to fuck with. 
5,8,Hardhome,I thought he was going to start freezing the sea and walking out towards them

5,8,Hardhome,[My reaction.](http://imgur.com/ivw83Qg)
5,8,Hardhome,Anyone else find it odd that the dude in the back of the boat at the end never took his hood off? I kept expecting it to be another White Walker who pulls the hood down and smiles SURPRISE!
5,8,Hardhome,"After tonight's episode, we're gonna need a bigger wall."
5,8,Hardhome,THERE THEY ARE. TEAM OTHERS HERE TO WRECK YOUR SHIT.
5,8,Hardhome,I'm just so glad Tormund lived.
5,8,Hardhome,GiantBro put the team on his back doe. 
5,8,Hardhome,You have got to be on the lookout for Ice Darth Maul. 
5,8,Hardhome,">Gendry rows into Hardhome


""FUCK THIS SHIT""


>Gendry rows away"
5,8,Hardhome,"Here's my speculation on what the white walkers are, since we got so much information this episode. 

So first off, we know that there are two types of white walker now, the skeletal footmen, which seem to be thralls, and the zombie-like white walkers, that command the cold and can cast magic. I'm going to say that those undead skeleton/zombies are not white walkers, but reanimated corpses that are thralls to the white walkers, as seen in the end. 

When that walker entered the burning hut, he extinguished the flames with frigid air, he had an aura of cold. He does not seem to be bothered by the flames at all. They are either some sort of manifestation of cold, or they can command cold. Since they seem to carry some sort of fancy staff/blade, they seem to have regal armour and metal trinkets on them, I'm going to say they are individualistic, and thus not a manifestation of the elements. Possibly some mages or warlocks of some kind.

The magic part at the end was interesting, he didn't have to chant anything to raise those corpses from the dead, he did not have to offer anything. Perhaps the dead corpses were the offering which allowed the white walkers to animate the corpses. Or simply killing things that were alive was the offering. That might explains as to why the white walkers needed babies from that guy in the hut, to create more undead. 

"
5,8,Hardhome,"Did anyone else think that hooded figure on Jon's boat was gonna turn out to be some deceptive zombie that was going to shank Jon during the camera pan?!?

""The walkers send their regards"" "
5,8,Hardhome,"Damn, even an hour after watching it I'm still so excited, I just smile like an idiot and fist bump randomly. This episode was damn perfect, Arya becoming a badass assassin, Cersei liсking the fucking floor, the awesome Dany and Tyrion dialogues and just to finish it off the best damn action sequence on the show and on any TV series, just so good overall"
5,8,Hardhome,Jon Snow may know nothing but he really really has some balls.
5,8,Hardhome,I think Olly interpreted Sams words different than most think.
5,8,Hardhome,"Nobody mentioned the way Tormund killed Lord of Bones? I was screaming ""Yeah! Say somethin'! say somethin' now biatch!"""
5,8,Hardhome,"I love how they did a pan up shot to the white walker riders on the cliff, really good metaphor for the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse. I think winter is here."
5,8,Hardhome,"I like how totally and utterly OBLIVIOUS the South is to what's actually happening in the North. They pass everything off as myths or that it's extinct when in reality Grumkins and Giant Ice Spiders may be the ONLY real myths. (Giant Ice Spiders may be real, but the Others choose to ride horses on the show.) Juries out on Grumkins.
"
5,8,Hardhome,"When that King White Walker rose his hands I thought he was going to make the entire sea into ice, trapping Jon Snow. But he rose the dead. HOLY SHIT. This episode gave me chills. Also I got a bit teary-eyed when Jon Snow made that speech about needing the freemen and the freemen needing them. I wonder how many people Jon Snow saved.


Also now that I think about it, this would be the worst circumstances to have ""women and children first"" cuz the white walkers will use these strong men as meat to add to their army. If they leave the women and children behind and save the strong men first then the white walker would have a weaker army. Sounds terrible, yes but if the humans want to survive, that seems to be the step to take."
5,8,Hardhome,So at the next white walker meeting maybe introduce the arrow so enemies cant just coast away on a boat
5,8,Hardhome,"At long last, this rotten world and all the nasty people who live in it are gonna get what they deserve."
5,8,Hardhome,Was really concerned about Giant's safety. Was happy when he reached deep waters without severe injuries.
5,8,Hardhome,"In a way, it was a recruitment drive by the white walkers."
5,8,Hardhome,And now none of your silly political storylines mean shit
5,8,Hardhome,Am I the only one who felt like this episode lasted 10 minutes ???
5,8,Hardhome,"Tormund didn't need to use that staff to kill the Lord of Bones. He could have just bashed the guy's skull in with his giant fucking cock.
"
5,8,Hardhome,Can we all take a moment to go on a feel train for Jorah? Dude gets banished AGAIN by the bae
5,8,Hardhome,"There was not a single second of this episode that I did not enjoy.

Tyrion talking circles around Dany, Arya acing her training, Cersei drinking water off of the floor, Roose Bolton's chocolatey voice, the girl from Pitch Perfect 2 kicking ass, zombie apocalypse... excuse me, I need to watch this again."
5,8,Hardhome,"GET. HYPE.

Shit's going down. Hardhome: check. Next two episodes: King's Landing and Meereen.

""Oh, you think all these dead people is bad? Now they're wights, muthafucka.""

Edit: Oh shit, I forgot about Winterfell and Dorne for a bit. All the slow stuff is over now.

Edit 2: And Braavos! I forgot about that even more, and I think Arya's story line is one of the better ones. The book 4/5 and s5e1-6 snoozer is over. It's payoff time!"
5,8,Hardhome,"If the White Walkers were in a video game, I guarantee they would get nerfed. "
5,8,Hardhome,"Also, Sauron on Ice."

Did anyone else think Drogon's entrance was/looked fucking awesome? I've waited a couple years and am completely satisfied with what I got (the green screen dragon riding part was a bit rough though). He looked amazing and Tyrion's reactions were great too. 

I'm looking forward to and am really anxious for the finale next week. Some people might hate D&D's guts even more now but I'm loving this wild ride. Embrace the fantasy, winter is coming."

5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"HOLY MOTHER OF ~~GOD~~ DRAGONS

I also loved Tyrion's reaction when Daario said the fastest man is best considering the last fight he witnessed went the other way (yes I'm aware that Oberyn technically beat Gregor) 

Edit: OK never mind not technically beat him in the duel, but clearly would have beaten him if he wasn't consumed for a confession 

Also Doran's face when Ellaria dropped her wine on the carpet was hilarious"
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"It's good to see American Pharaoh is starting to do some acting roles. But I'm surprised they're letting him do his own flame stunts.

5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Stannis may have burned his daughter, but at least it will fuck over the Boltons. Should be worth it, right? .................right?"
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"The first half of this episode, I kept asking myself: Why? Why do I keep watching this show? It is just week after week of emotional damage. I don't know who to root for anymore. Then, the second half came. I know why I watch this show. Even if it was a bit corny, that ending was awesome. Stannis is no longer 100% Mannis in my eyes though. RIP Shireen. Davos will be furious."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Since I'm free earlier than expected, I suppose I'll do my Departures Recap. Since I'd been out tonight I'd not planned to do one at all, but oh well. There were a LOT in this episode. Anything labeled S5E9 or earlier should be safe for viewers. Anything else is viewable AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Additionally, at certain points I will be *deliberately* omitting certain information regarding the books, so do not correct me on those points if you suspect they have been omitted under such circumstances.

**Book/Show Departures**

* Ramsay [ADWD/S5E9](#b ""doesn't leave Winterfell at all during Stannis's march. In the books, Stannis takes some time to ally with the reclusive mountain clans of the Wolfswood and retake Deepwood Motte from the Greyjoys before marching on Winterfell. By then, the winter is taking its toll on its own."") Also, imprisoning men when you are lacking manpower is a dumb idea and a little out of character for the experienced Stannis.
* Plot Hole: [S5E8](#s ""Why are Jon & co re-entering via the main tunnel here? The Wall has a port, it's called Eastwatch-by-the-Sea."") Neverthless I enjoy what they're doing with Ser Alliser. It actually makes him a more likeable character than in the books, and it doesn't actually feel out of place.
* [ADWD/S5E9](#b ""In the books, many Wildlings - such as Wun Wun the giant - actually stay at Castle Black through this agreement. Jon aims to man as many castles as possible with as many fighters as possible, and the Wildlings play a key role in that for obvious reasons."")
* I've stated many times already that by this point [ADWD/S5E9](#b ""Davos has been long gone from Stannis's side. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to win over Lord Wyman Manderly - one of the most powerful surviving Northern lords - to Stannis's cause."") That plotline appears to be mostly cut from the show, so I will not elaborate further upon it. As for the show, this development is absolutely necessary because it allows for what is about to happen...to happen. I'll elaborate later.
* IIRC it's explicitly stated in the books that [ADWD/S5E9](#b ""Stannis's starving troops are literally cannibalizing the dead, which is why he has several executed."") This is not shown in the show.
* I'm 99% the following (Dornish) plotline has been completely cut from the show, so I will explain it now in detail - look at your own risk: [AFFC](#b ""In the books, Doran Martell has three children - Arianne, Quentyn, and Tyrstane, in that order. Trystane is still betrothed to Myrcella, but both are barely double-digits in age. Arianne forms a plot of her own involving Myrcella after news of Joffrey's death reaches her. She seduces the Kingsguard sent to Dorne to guard Myrcella, Arys Oakheart, and convinces him to deliver Myrcella into the care of her and her allies. Arianne plans to rally Dornish support behind Myrcella and crown her Queen on the Iron Throne under ""Dornish laws"" [Dornish succession laws are gender-equal, and Myrcella is older than Tommen]. This is obviously not well thought-out. Arianne's party is quickly intercepted by Areo Hotah, her father's captain of the guard [the big axe-wielding black guy in the show]. Arys Oakheart ""suicides by cop"" against Hotah and Arianne's little rebellion is foiled, and her father puts her under house arrest until her spirit breaks. At which point Doran reveals...well....you'll just have to read the books yourself."")
* As an addendum to this plotline: [AFFC](#b ""Another Kingsguard, Balon Swann, is sent by Cersei to deliver the skull of Gregor Clegane to Prince Doran. Doran has him delayed as much as possible to prepare his explanation for Arys Oakheart's death. Cersei also sends Swann with orders to escort Doran and Trystane/Myrcella back to King's Landing, where Doran will assume a spot on the small council - however, she also issues him secret orders to allow an ambush along the way to murder Trystane, which he only very reluctantly obeys. Doran is aware this will happen, and has begun planning accordingly. This is where the books leave off."")
* There is yet another part to the Dornish plotline that has been 100% cut from the show: [AFFC/ADWD](#b ""Doran's eldest son, Quentyn, has been sent on a secret mission far to the east with a very small number of trusted vassals and retainers. His mission is a huge spoiler and I will not mention it here. Read the books yourself."")
* Ellaria Sand is actually expendable enough that Doran's threat to her is very real. She's the bastard daughter of Harmen Uller - while Uller is a powerful Dornish lord, he absolutely respects Doran, and I doubt he would be *too* angry at Doran executing his bastard daughter. In the books, [AFFC/S5E4](#b ""Doran has Ellaria and her daughters pre-emptively imprisoned and she plays no real role in the Dornish plotline."") Her [S5E9/AFFC](#b ""'breaking' scene is adapted from what Doran did to his daughter - he locked Arianne in a tower for an indeterminate amount of time and refused to allow any of her servants to interact with her. Eventually this caused Arianne to break down submit to his plans again."") He does this in abridged fashion to Ellaria, but in a much more blunt manner. It is nevertheless an effective way to convey Doran's power in a short time.
* With Arya, we're actually crossing into TWOW territory for this scene. This is a preliminary to a TWOW preview chapter, which takes place further into her storyline as a Faceless (Wo)man. [TWOW/Future Spoilers](#b ""In the books, Arya's 'revenge list' is considerably longer, mostly full of bit characters who are mere foot soldiers or characters she hasn't actually seen die yet. One of those is 'Raff the Sweetling.' He arrives in Braavos with the King's Hand in an identical situation. Arya poses as a young mummer/prostitute named Mercy [she is well into her training as a Faceless (Wo)man at this point] and lure Raff into a room alone, at which point she murders him."") As a side note, it was very disturbing (and undoubtedly deliberate) that the young girl Meryn chose greatly resembled Sansa.
* And finally, we're at the BIG MOMENT of this episode. Needless to say, [S5E9/ADWD](#s ""Stannis burning his own daughter doesn't happen in the books. Until this point, Show!Stannis was actually a somewhat more sympathetic character than Book!Stannis. But this action pushes him far over the Moral Event Horizon. I've mentioned repeatedly so far that Stannis leaves his wife, daughter, and Melisandre at Castle Black, where they are protected by loyal knights. This is a smart thing to do. However, the show's character arcs and plotlines demanded this happen. I will say, however, that this did not come out of left field. I didn't realize it until /r/asoiaf brought it to my attention shortly before S5 began, but this moment has been foreshadowed for at least two seasons - the power of 'king's blood,' Stannis's S3 conversation with Davos regarding the erosion of his religious skepticism due to witnessing Mel's miracles, Mel having Stannis stare deeply into the flames ~S2/S3, the S3E10 shot of Davos and Melisandre as metaphorical ""angel and devil on his shoulder"" respectively...Hence why I was not shocked in any way that this happened since before the season began, and was quickly convinced the theory was correct. And also, this is why Davos had to be sent away. Davos represented Show!Stannis's last connection to humanity - the McCoy to his long-tormented Kirk. The angel on his shoulder countering Mel's devil. While there are numerous plot holes regarding Stannis's characterization here, I am willing to ignore them because this HAS in fact been foreshadowed for a VERY LONG time in show terms - any holes are likely just oversights resulting from having several differing writers."") That's my lengthy spiel on that subject. EDIT: [The Stannis-Davos scene I mentioned, AKA the biggest single foreshadowing moment for the culmination that resulted this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXoa8g_9WEo)

So I literally can't fit what's coming next into this one post, so I'll copy it and reply in a second."

Does anyone else think Jaqen H'gar sending Arya left at the street instead of right, to the edge of the docks, where sailors/travelers would be boarding onto land, wasn't for the sake of finding the gambler? Maybe the real target all along was Meryn Trant. Remember, Jaqen does know the list of names that Arya has!"

5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Even after beheading the main character of season 1, the Red Wedding, Oberyn's head explosion, and Sansa's rape, I still told myself, ""No way they go this far. No way Game of Thrones literally burns a child alive and lets us hear her screams"" Even when Melisandre lit the wood. I thought ""how is she going to get out of this. How is Stannis going to stop this.""

Wtf. I'm so conditioned to think the worst and stop with the ""how are they going to get out of this pickle"" in this show and I still fell for it. Jesus."

* Shireen ... well, no one saw that one coming, right?
* Really didn't see it coming that her mother would be genuinely sorry for her.
* Hizdhar was not the Harpie it seems, well played.
* Drogon needs to upgrade his armor skills, black arrows should be the only projectiles worthy of wounding a dragon.
* Meryn Trant will hopefully be caught by Sexy Jesus wearing Chris Hanson's face.
* Things are pretty chill in Dorne it seems."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,Shereen perfectly demonstrates why you should check the terms and conditions before saying 'I agree'
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"I'm sure this has already been posted...but here goes:  

Critics complain about the deus ex machina appearance of Drogon's during the fight with the Harpies.  But, they seem to forget that Drogon's appearance was foreshadowed at the end of episode 2, ""The House of Black and White.""  When Dany was in distress (or depressed), she went out on the balcony overlooking Meeren and Drogon appeared--almost as if he was checking on her.  She reached out to him and he flew away.  

I feel like the writers were informing the viewers that there is an emotional connection between Drogon and Dany.  I am aware that earlier in the episode, there was a riot--so why wouldn't Drogon appear then?  Maybe he was really far away at the time...

I don't know just a theory...hopefully not tinfoil. "

You'd think Stannis would get teleported straight through the iron throne with Cercei acting as his ottoman after that sacrifice."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,An incredible stroke of luck for Dany - Drogon runs out of clean laundry and returns home on the day of the big fighting pits event.

5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Oh god dammit, Stannis "
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,Do your thing Brienne.
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"That explains why Stannis sent off Davos. He *knew* that Davos would try to talk some sense into him and try to stop it. 

When Davos sat down and had that moment with Shireen, I knew for sure that she would be a goner before the end of this episode.

Who would want to follow a man who would torch his daughter for his own personal gain? That is a new level of effed up. 

""No man is so accursed as the kinslayer."""
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"To all those who think Davos will abandon Stannis after returning: Theres no way that Davos didn't know what was about to happen. Think about the scene where he was talking to Stannis and asking him if he could take Shireen back to the wall. Right after Stannis says ""she stays with me."", He sees Melisandre and Selyse over the King's shoulder implying ""Yeah I have something planned for Shireen alright"". Davos giving her a gift to cheer her up just goes further to show that he understood her fate, IMO. If he were going to protest, he would have done so already."

Just trying to get a character out of this... is LoL set up so that he CAN'T help without kingsblood, or just *won't*?  Why would kingsblood matter?  Baratheon wasn't a long-standing noble line.

Shireen was the only thing that cold man loved, so imagine being him then. In his mind, he HAD to choose between the one thing he loves, and saving WESTEROS. So I'm actually still aboard the Stannis train.

5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Is it bad that I'm not suddenly anti-Stannis after this episode? Maybe it's just because I saw it coming, but you could tell it wasn't exactly easy for him to make that decision. I don't know, maybe this show has really started to fuck me up."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Can anyone tell me *why*, after all her talk, Melisandre couldn't or wouldn't stop the fires in the camp?"
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,[deleted]
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Maybe it's just me, but I thought the dragons would be more powerful. I found myself worried for Drogon.

I think we're gonna need more than 3 dragons to put a dent in the White Walker army."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,D&D’s character assassination of Stannis Baratheon is now complete. 
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Best part of the season!

Never felt happier while watching than when Drogon came in and started fucking shit up."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Stannis... What have you become? Poor Shireen's screams are tattooed onto my brain. Fuck, my 2nd favorite character is now dead to me, kinda want Roose to beat him now. 

Red wedding flashbacks here at the fighting pits, then our boy Drogon shows up and shows us why you don't fuck with Dany. Not the typical 9th epiposde but goddamn it was good. 

This season started off pretty slow but these last few episodes are among the best of the whole series, I'm left feeling uneasy after the last 2 especially."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,This episode just proved Cersei right: everywhere in the world they hurt little girls.
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,Rip Princess Shireen of the House Baratheon. 
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,Seems like Shireen's actress got fired.
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,Really was holding out hope that Yoda and the Clone warships were gonna fly in and save the day. 
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Why does Dany only keep like 4 or 5 of the weakest unsullied around at any given time? I'm starting to think that the unsullied are actually just a scam. They're probably not even trained as soldiers.

And where are the second sons that she acquired from Dario? They were never mentioned after that episode where Daario pledges them to her.

Also, Cersei is a monster but she at least loves her kids. Stannis' wife let someone let her child on fire before she had second thoughts. What the fuck, Stannis and her are the real bad guys."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Not going to lie, am disappointed that Jorah got his ass handed to him in that fight with the fancy dude, only to be alive by the grace of luck"
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"My reaction before Shireens death scene was the same as Shireen during her death scene...

Fuck you Stannis"
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,A King who kills his own daughter is no king of mine. Fuck you Stannis.
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis the Mannis has become Stannis the Menace.....father of the year award REVOKED
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,Shireen got to me. I almost cried in front of my fiance. Fuck Stannis got dammit. Fuck Olly too.
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis has lost it completely. He's gone insane. Even his wife who wanted Shireen dead was drawn to tears. Something tells me Davos is also done with Stannis. 
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,So is Arya going to be undercover fresh meat for Trant next episode?  
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,Stannis Baratheon: Daughter Slayer
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,That's it. I'm rooting for the White Walkers. They're more human than these sick bastards currently inhabiting Westeros.
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Ser Davos is gonna lose his shit when he gets back, he should have taken her with him."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"With all the other stuff going on this episode, can we pause to acknowledge Tyrion's awesome jump/ throat slash? 

"
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"I just don't think any of you understand Stannis' character from the books at all. Stannis is a weak ruler, clinging to his misguided notion of justice. He allowed the Red Woman and his wife to manipulate him into murdering a large number of his vassals, and his wife's kin merely to satisfy R'hllor. You guys have been on Stannis' nuts so religiously that you ignore example after example of weakness being masked by duty and ceremony. 

Give it a damn rest. Stannis has been Lawful Neutral/Slightly Evil since day 1. I mean, his treatment of Maester Cressen and reaction to his death is our first interaction with him and he comes off as a total douche. Because he let Davos live and made statements lamenting the death of Ned Stark, he is somehow a protagonist?"
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,You know what? Fuck it. No Iron Throne for anyone. I'm Team White Walkers now. At least they're honest.
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"The unsullied are the worst fucking pvpers ever, there is litteraly a guy with A MASK behind the queen who you are supposed to defend, and then you all get overrun by fkin pocket knives PLEASE."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"After last night, the list of characters I'm rooting for is down to 4.

1. Khaleesi
1. Jon Snow
1. Sansa Stark
1. Tyrion Lannister

Edit: Forgot about Jorah"
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Melisandre had better be summoning a fucking Balrog from this now, the homewrecking hussy."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Whatever happened to ""You're Princess Shireen of House Baratheon, and you, are my daughter...""
:'("
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,Well I guess that guy *wasn't* the leader of the Harpies
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Davos was nearly killed in the battle at Blackwater, nearly killed again by Stannis shortly after, and once again when he released Gendry (by Stannis). But now he is really going to die when he finds out about Shireen."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,[deleted]
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"Am i the only one thinking that there was enough room on the back of Drogon to fit Missandei, Tyrion, Daario and Jorah?

It's like Titanic all over again."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"I really wish they hadn't even bothered going the greyscale route with Jorah. The amount of people asking questions about everyone in the show potentially getting infected as if this is the walking dead is absolutely infuriating. I mean, I don't read the books, so I'm not the *most* keen on the events within, but people aren't watching the same show I am if they think that Greyscale is going to be the thing that wipes out half of Westeros."
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,[deleted]
5,9,The Dance of Dragons,"As a father, holy shit was Shireen's death hard to take. 

But I don't think it was as out of character for Stannis as all the butthurt recaps are making out.

Stannis is chiefly a selfish man. It's been plain all along. He assassinated his own brother. He accommodated and then embraced the horrific practices of the Lord of Light because of what they did for him. Go back and watch his ""Father of the year"" speech. While I think he does love Shireen, it strikes me that the reason he went to the lengths he did wasn't for LOVE of his daughter, but for love of HIS daughter. 

Because Shireen was his, she sort of got wrapped up in that selfishness. Until her well-being came up against his own.

I'll be very curious to see where this storyline closes out after next week. With Stannis, Davos, Ramsey, Sansa, Theon and Brienne all in play, hot damn it could get interesting."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Jaime gets the awkward dad award 
5,10,Mother's Mercy,just a reminder for what we knew all along: it sucks to be a Stark
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Brienne: ""Renley, the rightful heir.""

Stannis: ""...bitch you realize I'm the older brother right?"""
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Next year on Game of Thrones: Every character is dead. The writers start killing viewers at home.
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Undead Jon Snow is going to infiltrate the White Walkers and find out there's an even more powerful evil force further north that they are fleeing from. He has to convince The Night's Watch and the Wildlings to let the White Walkers settle south of the wall because Super Winter is coming.

Winter has come and *The Winds of Winter* has not. 

Gods help us, for now we are truly lost. "

5,10,Mother's Mercy,"You've got to be fucking kidding me. If Melisandre doesn't bring him back to life, I couldn't care less about anyone on the Watch dying by the hand of the White Walkers."

5,10,Mother's Mercy,If Melisandre doesn't revive Jon I'm gonna go die in a hole.

What an episode. Did not expect any of that

This show is going to make me sad every time I hear cello now. Too many emotions

continue to edit: So did Theon and Sansa jump to death or into a snowbank? It was a snowbank right?"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Hope Olly gets eaten by a fucking thenn 
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Who else is team White Walkers now????
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Guysguys, calm down. Melisandre obviously didn't use her noble blood juice on Stannis, because guess what? She's using it to resurrect Jon so that he's free from his vows and free to be king."

Edit: Even if Jon can be brought back to life. The Night's Watch is full of idiots.

2. White walkers recruit Jon Snow
3. New undead Jon kills everyone at the wall 
4. Profit "
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"More than anyone, I feel bad for Myrcella. She's just a girl who's been caught in the middle of a conflict she didn't create and which she's tried to overcome. Every block that's been put in front of her, she's grown over. She forgave Jaime and loved him anyway. She went alone to Dorne and won everyone's hearts even though they hated her one principle. Not only that, she was really, really weirdly chill about the Sand Snakes trying to kill her.   

I know it's good drama, but damn it hurts. "

5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Stannis Baratheon: The man who lost everything for nothing. Melisandre is absolutely shitty at interpreting her visions (read her chapter in ADWD before you jump the gun and say she conspired to do this). 

Seeing Cersei go from having some sense of confidence at the beginning of her atonement to breaking down in shame was very well done, this was a woman who was told she was one of the most beautiful in Westeros and now she’s called a whore. 

Was not looking forward to seeing “For the watch,” he took a much more brutal death in the show.

EDIT: Some people are saying Melisandre fooled Stannis (EDIT 3: Stop thinking I believe this, a couple of people kept sending this to me). Though this could be true, she's actually not as competent of a priestess as she appears to be. In her chapter in ADWD she had difficulties interpreting her visions. However, D&D could also choose to omit Melisandre's incompetence for the show.

EDIT 2: No I don't think she was trying to fool Stannis, don't need to tell me again."

5,10,Mother's Mercy,"How stupid is Ellaria?  ""I'm going to send Dorne's only heir off with some people who are DEFINITELY GONNA KILL HIM, ONCE I GIVE THEM THIS TERRIBLE REASON TO.""

Edit:  A lot of people are pointing out to me that she wants to start a war.  IMO, that just makes her more of an idiot.  She's sacrificing the only legitimate heir to Dorne and alienating the one person who, under Westerosi law, could legitimize one of the Sand Snakes.  She's essentially sacrificing the future of Dorne for a foolish war for what she perceives as vengeance, even though *she was there* and knows that Oberyn volunteered for the fight.

At this rate she'll be lucky if Doran doesn't get out of his chair and curb stomp her when he finds out what she's done."

NOW I KNOW WHAT READERS FELT FOR RED WEDDING

HOW DARE THEY KILL SELYSE


"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"My resident disclaimer: All spoilers marks S5E10 or earlier should be safe for show-watchers, other than that, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK. Then again, we're pretty much almost completely caught up with each other, save for the plots that have been completely cut from the show and some other things. Departures will be interspersed with my own comments.

**Book/Show Departures**

* As said last week, there was [ADWD/S5E9](#s ""No burning of Shireen in the books, and thus no Selyse hanging herself. They're both safe and well back at Castle Black in the books."")
* Jon sending [AFFC/S5E10](#b ""Sam to the Citadel at Oldtown was much earlier in the books, and was Jon's suggestion. Sam didn't want to go."")
* I mean it makes sense somewhat at this point, but I'm rather annoyed they had Stannis's army marching as a disorganized mob rather than an actual army in formation.
* In the books, [ADWD/TWOW/S5E10](#b ""Stannis doesn't yet reach Winterfell. He's still trapped in a blizzard, so Roose Bolton sends part of his garrison out to take him out while weakened and isolated. There's tons of speculation from here about the impending 'Battle of Ice,' which will happen early in TWOW."") [AFFC/ADWD](#b ""Additionally, the Boltons aren't sitting pretty. Their hold on the North is extremely tenuous, not helped by the chaos going on in King's Landing following Cersei's imprisonment. There's actually a great conspiracy by the northern lords who despise the Boltons due to the Red Wedding to destabilize and ultimately turn against them. It's been set up for two books and is waiting to fire in TWOW. I'm very disappointed this all got cut from the show, since it includes one of the most badass fucking speeches in the series."")
* Again, [AFFC/S5E10](#s ""Brienne's"") not in the North in the show, so no scene with [S5E10](#s ""Stannis."")
* And y'know I'll say this: [S5E10](#s ""This is a really fucking unsatisfying ending for Stannis's storyline. No I'm not talking about Brienne being the one to do him in - that part was pretty good from a character arc perspective. I'm talking about how this storyline has been built up and built up all season and it just ends with him losing and everyone left we should be rooting for dying. Like, I'm not opposed to having a 'Reality Ensues - Magic Don't Real Idiot' twist, but for fuck's sake this shit is so fucking depressing now. I swear the show has been more dark and depressing than the books, and I hate it. There's a trope for this - it's called 'Darkness Induced Audience Apathy.' This is doubly true because I already know what's going to happen at the end of this episode, which will take away one of the very last characters with any power who we can possibly feel good about rooting for. At least in the books, fucking evil, despicable characters DO get their comeuppance over time, since that's what happens to evil, despicable people in real life - here, none of it is shown, it's all cut."") That's a rant done. Then again, there's always the possibility [S5E10](#s ""he's not dead - he didn't actually die on screen. Don't see no body."")
* And FINALLY, [ADWD/S5E10](#b ""Theon gets his redemption. In the books, he is the POV character for Winterfell, so we get to read his thoughts and emotions. His redemption in the book is very gradual, with the turning point coming at a scene in the godswood where he begs the old gods to allow him to die as Theon rather than Reek - it's a really powerful scene. It turns out like it does here - he rescues Jeyne Pool (who as said in previous posts in posing as a fake Arya and serves as Ramsay's wife in the books) even though he knows she's not Arya, jumps off the wall into a snowbank, and eventually gets found by Stannis's men. Except, in the show Stannis is dead and his army scattered, so I've got no fucking clue where they're gonna go now."")
* In the books, [AFFC/S5E10](#s ""Arya totally kills random people while in her fake personas and gets away with it. I'm not sure whether or not the Kindly Man (whose role Jaqen fills in the show) knows about these."")
* [AFFC/S5E10](#s ""Jaqen killing himself OR NOT mindfuck was actually a really effective scene that demonstrates how fucking weird and disturbing the Faceless Men and their philosophy truly are. Arya does get blinded in the books as part of her education as a Faceless (Wo)man, but IIRC it happens earlier."")
* Needless to say, [AFFC/S5E10](#s ""~10-year-old Myrcella isn't dead in the books. She's caught up in a cut plot involving Doran's daughter Arianne, which I believe I've touched upon in previous posts, and loses an ear. However, she survives. While I don't think Myrcella's death was badly done - I feel they foreshadowed it with the Sand Snake's spiel to Bronn in prison about the poison - I do think it renders this Dorne storyline a complete shaggy dog story. Also, Ellaria assassinating Myrcella AFTER THE LANNISTERS TOOK OFF WITH DORAN'S ONLY SON AND HEIR is up there as one of the top 5 dumbest fucking decisions in the whole series."")
* And Tyrion's ability to speak Valyrian is revealed. We book-readers have been wondering when it would be.
* Tyrion-Daario-Jorah has the makings of a whacky roommate sitcom. I guess we'll just have to settle with the Daario-Jorah buddy cop comedy.
* Daario showing off that he's somewhat smarter than his book counterpart. In the books he really doesn't care about politics or subtlety - he's basically the symbolic personification of the seductive nature of violence.
* [ADWD/S5E10](#s ""Varys never shows up in Meereen in the books. He actually disappears for most of AFFC and ADWD. In fact, here in the show I'm surprised he's here at all rather than another certain place..."")
* [ADWD/S5E10](#b ""Dany is in remarkably better shape at Drogon's den than in the books. In the books, riding and hunting with a big dragon for weeks takes a big toll on her clothing and body."")
* [ADWD/S5E10](#s ""The Walk of Shame was very well-done. They've been building up to this in a way since season one - this is the very first time we see Cersei naked despite numerous opportunities. One scene in particular comes to mind - when she is post-coitus with Lancel, he is naked, but she is fully clothed. IIRC, Lena Headey herself has commented that these decisions have been deliberate, because Cersei being clothed in scenes represents her having power and agency, but lacking clothes she now has none."")
* SER ROBERT STRONG HYPE
* And finally, something we book-watchers have been anticipating since 2011: [ADWD/S5E10](#b ""'For The Watch.' It is vastly different in the books. Here in the show, it kind of comes out of nowhere after just one questionable decision that WE THE AUDIENCE *KNOW* ISN'T QUESTIONABLE AT ALL. In the books, Jon makes a series of questionable and very unpopular decisions that cause this mutiny. Remember that we don't see what happens at Hardhome in the books. Additionally, in the books the leader of this mutiny is a character named Bowen Marsh. He's the head steward of the Night's Watch, and plays only a bit part until Jon becomes Lord Commander. After that, Marsh's advice is increasingly marginalized and ignored by Jon in the name of the apparent greater good, and it's very clear Marsh is becoming very disgruntled. The final straw comes when a letter arrives from Ramsay Bolton boasting about having defeated and destroyed Stannis's army, that he's been raping Arya Stark, and that he's planning to come north and wipe out the Night's Watch next (it's very obvious that these are exaggerations or outright lies, but there are kernels of truth that make it all ambiguous to the reader) - Jon resolves to rally an army of Night's Watch and wildling volunteers and march south to kill Ramsay. This action is COMPLETELY anathema to the mission of the Night's Watch and can very easily get it for sure destroyed by the lords for interfering in their affairs - thus the issue of Marsh and his conspirators knifing Jon is a little more murky in the books. Additionally, Ser Alliser Thorne is not part of the mutiny - IIRC he is sent away to command one of the newly-reoccupied forts in the books. I knew they were going to do this this season, but figured it would end up rushed and somewhat confusing- lo and behold..."")

So yeah, at this point the show is almost entirely caught up with the books, at least generally speaking plot-wise. The book-readers do *enormous* amounts of speculation while we're sitting on our thumbs, so feel free to head over to /r/asoiaf and read up on some of the more choice theories. Just be warned, though - in /r/asoiaf you'll be exposed to very sensitive book-only plotlines that were cut from the show and that I've largely omitted from these posts, so don't head there if you plan on actually reading the books."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Olly is such a little shit. Fuck that kid.
5,10,Mother's Mercy,My favorite part was when Myranda's head exploding off a stone like a watermelon does from Gallagher's sledgehammer.
5,10,Mother's Mercy,What the actual fuck
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Melisandra will bring back Jon with the powers of the lord of light. Calling it.
5,10,Mother's Mercy,IS STANNIS DEAD?!
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Fuck the Watch.

5,10,Mother's Mercy,"**HOLY SHIT, WHAT IS GOING ON?!**"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,.... So about that plot armor?
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Props to Lena Headey for being able to do that scene in front of so many other people.... for being able to do that scene at all.  
edit: Apparently it was a body double. Damnit."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,FUCK THIS SHOW HOW COULD YOU KILL JON
5,10,Mother's Mercy,The night is dark and full of fucking bullshit. 
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"""Takes face off"" SURPRISE BITCH!!!"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"I refuse to believe the Mannis is dead. They would have just fucking shown it if Brienne actually killed him. Also, the show writers wouldn't have deliberately sent Mel back to the wall, the same place she is in the book (she never went with Stannis in the book), unless she was meant to be there to revive Jon. I have faith Jon and Stannis will be back next season people don't you worry. Being betrayed by the Night's Watch allows him to be free of his vows and sets him up for great things next season.

If they aren't FUCK EVERYTHING!

**P.S. FUCK OLLY! FUCK THE NIGHTS WATCH! FUCK THOSE TURN-CLOAKS AND TRAITORS THAT ABANDONED THE MANNIS AND FUCK EVERYTHING ELSE WITH THIS EPISODE!**

The only parts that didn't destroy me inside was the Clegane bowl hype and Dany trying to get her charizard to listen to her when she didn't have enough badges. GODDAMN IT! I HATE THIS SHOW! AAAARRRRGGGHHHH! SEE YOU NEXT SEASON!"

5,10,Mother's Mercy,So what you're saying is benjen isn't coming?
5,10,Mother's Mercy,I just want to thank all the book readers.  I never had any idea about Jon's fate.  You guys can keep a secret and I love it.  Much respect
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"You hear that?

That's the sound of all the Jon/Dany shippers collectively losing their goddamn minds."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Nights Watch: We just witnessed one of the most horrific slaughters we've ever seen and the dead just rose up again. You know what our biggest threat to us is? Jon Snow's bringing in those 200 Wildlings. Fuck that guy. 
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"I HEREBY DECLARE KING BALON GREYJOY, LORD REAVER OF PYKE, KING OF THE IRON ISLANDS AS THE WINNER OF THE WAR OF THE FIVE KINGS, AS THE ONLY SURVIVING COMPETITOR! "
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"After this episode I feel like the show will end with some person climbing onto the Iron Throne at the end feeling pretty good about themselves because they are the only major player left. The Night's King will then dramatically appear, kill them and take over. The last 3 minutes will basically just be the opening theme playing in reverse showing the entire world  turning to ice, dying and finally ending with the sun thing going out. 

It will then cut to GRRM who will say 'and the moral of the story kids is that people are stupid and our selfish actions are going to bring about the end of the world' He will then proceed to swan dive off a balcony into a room filled with money and tears while laughing maniacally."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"That's it, I'm team White Walkers now.  Burn this shit down, let the Winter come and go, and rebuild.  This place is well and truly fucked.

5,10,Mother's Mercy,**THE EYE COLOR**
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"This episode was overkill. Literally. I feel they should have used some of the plot for earlier episodes and ended with a little less cliff hangers. I mean, there was a lot of shock value for sure, but it does not sit right with me for some reason.

Also, what about Margaery/Loras?"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Umm where the hell was Ghost? He saves Sams ass two episodes earlier but just takes vacation time when Jon is getting mercilessly shanked?
5,10,Mother's Mercy,stage 1: [denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model)
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Could Melisandre brings back Jon like that one guy the hound killed was brought back? Or was he special like that was his gift from the Lord of Light?
5,10,Mother's Mercy,[removed]
5,10,Mother's Mercy,FUCK THIS SHOW :'(
5,10,Mother's Mercy,I want the white walkers to kill everyone up until it's just little finger and Varys and they high five and detonate the doomsday device and a B29 drops Hodor on westoros with bronn yeehawing on his back all the way down Dr. Strangelove style and then it just turns the seven kingdoms into glass  
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Fuck. Olly. 
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"WTF U CANT JUST KILL JON



NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,The Nights Watch is the shittiest organization. Constantly killing leaders. I hope the White Walkers fuck their shit up. 
5,10,Mother's Mercy,[deleted]
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Stannis: ""Cut her down... have her butchered for meat""."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"""Well they killed all the good people, but kept the shit stains.""

I don't think my Dad understands this show.

EDIT: I say that because he said there's no reason to watch anymore."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Even though Sir Alliser hated Jon, i can't actually believe he would plot to kill him. Jon is the commander of the Night's Watch, and for an honorable man like Thorne, i just don't understand how his character would betray his commander.


Also, fuck Olly."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Dead, or just Mostly Dead?

Jon - Mostly dead. Which means slightly alive.  Lets not look for loose change just yet.  We may not have a Miracle Max, but we do have a Melisandre.

Sansa - Unlikely.  No Giant with white horses at the bottom of the fall, but holding hands during the leap of faith gives a +1 for the landing.

Reek - See above.  Plus he's going to come back super pissed and out for revenge.  He won't be able to look at another breakfast sausage until he does.  Reek jumped, Theon landed.

Stannis - Uncertain.  Breinne has an overdeveloped sense of honor.  That gets her in trouble a lot.  We didn't actually see his death.  We heard a sword strike, but there were still bad guys from Winterfell in the woods.  Or it could have just been that tree he was leaning on.

Arya - Unsanctioned killing caused her to loose face.  Is on double secret probation until at least three episodes next season.

Myrcella - Probably, but then again, maybe not.  Her fiancée, Trystane, is also on the boat.  From the scene on shore, we know that even after the bloody nose, if the antidote is given, it's not a big deal.  Trystane may have the cure, and as a long shot, Bronn, also on board, may also have pocketed some as a precaution against another Sand Snake encounter.

Sister Mary Confess - I think Mostly Dead, at least in Cersei's mind, but she will make sure that she is all dead soon enough.


"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"""for the watch"" damnn these guys straight up gangsta they kill him and steal his watch too. "
5,10,Mother's Mercy,I can't believe Benjen warged into a piece of wood. That's the big reveal no one's talking about. And how he just let them stab Jon??
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Even now, I can't hate Stannis. I only pity him.

He gave up everything he had to save the Seven Kingdoms. 

Home, daughter, wife; he threw it all away to become the king that saves the world. 

And he failed. Horribly. But he met his end like a man.

""Go on. Do your duty.""
"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"I know this will get lost in here, but here are my thoughts. (Only Thoughts No Spoilers)

Jon Snow saves all of the Wildings Lives, gives them a better home and pardons them. Sam comes back to see that john was very hurt and if it was not for MS (fire Bitch) he would be dead. The wildings are no longer in front of the wall, they are behind the wall and Sam has realizes the dangers in the trust of some of the men of the night watch and realizes they are more harm then help against the White Walkers. So Sam decides to Fix the issue by talking with the wildings explaining Jons sacrifice in helping them and losing his own men. The wildings don't have an all righteous law they abide to, only Justice and John has already told the wildings how weak Castle Black really is. Now that they are on the opposite side of the wall John has a very powerful army already, that will fight for him. So with Sams help the Wildings take over castle black and also provide Jon with enough men (Loyal Men) to man more than one castle on the wall. 

Also ""Olly"" that little fucker gets kicked in the nuts by Gilly. (This would be my favorite part)"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,OH MY FUCKING GOD
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"So, wait, even if Jon is a bastard, he still has the royal blood, right?

And the witch bitch can do magic with the royal blood, and she's back...

Calling it, Jon's gonna come back"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"So with this season over, I know this is the question everyone is left with: when is Margaery doing her walk of atonement? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,BOTH OF MY FAVORATE CHARACTERS FUCKING DIED
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Did it bother anybody else when Brienne was doing her whole ""Renly Baratheon, first of his name.."" Bit, and proceeds to call him the rightful heir to the throne?

Err... No he wasn't. I get that you were devoted to him, but let's not lie here. "
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"In that last Myrcella scene, I remember thinking that she's so pure and forgiving and just generally such a ""good"" character, plus she has the potential for a happy future with Tristain who is also lovely. 

Which means that there's no way she isn't going to die. 

Cue blood from nose. "
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Beginning to question the point of watching the show. Soon the whole thing will be sub characters. 
5,10,Mother's Mercy,What the hell happened to Margaery?
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"I, for one, welcome our new ice zombie overlords."

5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Annnnd in the red corner, The Mountain, ladies and gents. Can't wait for Season 6 :)"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,So can we all acknowledge how absolutely BRUTAL Arya is? 
5,10,Mother's Mercy,John_Snow : rez plz thx 
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Cersei.  Stannis.  Melisandre.  

It takes an amazing actor/actress to make me feel for characters who have done such terrible things.  All three of them were broken this episode, and all three of them lost all self-confidence this episode for the first time ever.  Hats off to them - acting like this is really keeps me watching this show."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Something that a lot of people aren't talking about either, but a character I love. Qyburn, he super nice and loyal to cersei, had a towel for her and RAN immediately to help cover her up. Everyone else in that room just stared at her doing nothing. Like wtf? I thought as soon as she made it to the kings guard and lannisters that a soldier would pick her up and help her ASAP, but no GGG Qyburn to the rescue!"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,I swear the Starks are fucking cursed or something. Fuck. 
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Does Stannis remind anyone else of Napoleon? Known as the greatest military commander of his time, exiled to a small island after a new group of people seize power in his homeland, manages to get a new army from the people who used to support his enemy, makes the mistake of trying to take a frozen wasteland just as winter is setting in, loses half his forces to desertion and/or starvation because they aren't used to the harsh conditions, which ends up costing him the battle.. 

I know those things happened in a different order for Napoleon, but still."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Fuck this show. 
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Well guys, guess I need to find a new show to watch...FUCK"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Can we get a flair for the Night King? He is officially the only character I support. Destroy it all, Night King, destroy it all

Edit: NVM I FOUND IT"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Olly u little shit.
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"So can Melisandre do the same thing that Thoros of Myr can do? She has to, I refuse to accept anything otherwise. "
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"WHAT THE FUCK? PLZ LORD OF LIGHT.

""Lord cast your light upon this man your servant, bring him back from death and darkness, his flame has been extinguished restore it!"""
5,10,Mother's Mercy,And now his watch has ended.... meaning if he gets resurrected he is no longer bound by his vows and can conquer Westros like he was always meant to!!!!
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Please tell me Melisandre knows that Fire God revival bullshit.
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Fuck the Nights Watch. Fuck Kings Landing. Fuck the Boltons. Fuck Olly. There is only one true king now and when he arrives ice and death will come down on all unworthy. All the hail the Nights King, the true king in the north."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"as much as i like seeing melisandre proven wrong and looking like an idiot, PLEASE USE YOUR BITCH MAGIC ON JON"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"If Jon stays dead, I hope he becomes the Hand of the Night's King and the White Walkers and the Wights skull fuck the Night's Watch to death. #fuckolly"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Ramsey's whore hit rock bottom
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"As devastating as Jon's death was, the look on Davos' face when he found out about Shireen was the saddest moment of the entire show."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Best thing about Cersei's scene were those two leading Sparrows playing whack-a-mole on the crowd with their truncheons.
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Now that The Mannis is (possibly dead) and House Baratheon is gone, that leaves Dany as the next in line for the throne because of Robert's grandmother being a Targaryen.
As Dany's oldest child, this also leaves Drogon as second in line to the Iron Throne.
Dragon King confirmed."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Fucking twat Olly.
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Jaime: So, sis, anything happen while I was out of town? I like the new haircut, by the way...

Cersei: Oh, you know . . . same old, same old. But I'm so glad to see you! I could use some good news right about now. Hey, where's Myrcella?"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,FUCK OLLY
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Honestly, at this point killing off the ""good guys"" isn't exciting anymore. It's just cynical."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Still no LSH 

I give up"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Did anyone else find Theon throwing that bitch to her death extremely satisfying? Especially that sound she made when she hit the ground.
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Can we just take a second to praise the acting of Lena Heady? I feel like we watched her go from being kind of strong at the beginning of her atonement, thinking, I can fucking do this, I got this, how hard can this be, almost fucking smug... to being completely psychologically beaten down, covered in shit, and truly hated... and the whole time she is going through this she looks up at the Red Keep in determination, thinking of nothing but her son. She literally went through that, in order to get back to her son. Cersei is a total fucking bitch but the love she has for her children was so apparent in that scene. The acting was fucking incredibly. I mean Cersei totally deserved that slice of humble pie, I'm not necessarily feeling for her character, but the acting, by god. I was so convinced. Can't wait to see if her attitude in general changes or if she will go back to her old ways. "

5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Man out of all the deaths (?) Myrcella's death was the saddest and just when Jaime finally gets some peace in his life. Saw it coming the moment Ellaria kissed her but still depressing. Out of all Cersei's children (Vicious Idiot and Useless) Myrcella was the most likable. I can't root for Ellaria and the sand snakes now. Idiots who kill innocent children are no better than the Mountain.

Jon and Stannis on the other hand are probably still alive or at least coming back."
5,10,Mother's Mercy,Can't wait for Cersei to kill everyone in the Faith Militant next season.
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Honestly, on the watch's part, that was the dumbest and most shortsighted thing they could've done. 

•Jon is now the only one with experience against an actual white walker. As far as we know, he didn't get the chance to tell anyone except Sam that valyrian steel kills them

•Jon had so many allies at the wall in his brothers, they'll almost certainly turn against Thorne now. 

•Jon was the only person the wildlings would follow. 

•There are now more wildlings in Castle Black than Brothers, and there's nothing to stop them from killing every crow there. 

•Ghost has like, the highest kill count on the show and he pretty much roams free, he's going to wreck shit. "

5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Two nitpicks from the last two episodes:

- Where the hell are all these deserters going to? The road goes to Winterfell at one end and Castle Black at the other. Neither is going to be very welcoming. I can't imagine bands of sellswords and southern deserters are going to find welcome or even sufficient plundering targets or adequate food in the North.
- Why did the survivors of Hardhome disembark and walk back to Castle Black on the *North* side of the wall? Was it really that hard to sail a few hundred extra feet, disembark at Eastwatch by the Sea and take the damn road on the safe side of the wall? Perhaps they might have borrowed a few horses and sent off a couple of ravens, even."

5,10,Mother's Mercy,"The common theory with a twist, hear me out. 
So the Jon is dead but he will be ressurected by Mellisandre theory is very popular, but what if things go a little different.
Another possibility is that the Brothers will arrange his ""funeral"", they will burn him along his sword. And out of fire (just like Dany) he will be reborn, with a flaming sword. Azor Ahai. Reborn a man, free of his duty to the Night's Watch.
At the moment, in the show, Mellisandre does not really ""believe"" in Jon as much as she does in the books. This event will turn her to his side."

5,10,Mother's Mercy,DARTH CLEGANE RISES!
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"Et tu, Ollie?"
5,10,Mother's Mercy,"I used to say that this show being depressingly realistic/dark was one of its best points. I had seen a few posts saying that RR Martin/this show kind of uses it as a gimmick, being excessively ""heart-renching"" and killing beloved characters not as much for plot development but just for its effect. I shrugged it off and said they were too sensitive.

After this finale...I'm honestly starting to reconsider. It's starting to seem like George RR Martin is getting us to like characters literally just to get them killed later. It worked amazingly in prior seasons but now it's starting to get gimmickly to the point where viewers can rather accurately predict in advance which characters are going to be killed based on how they're ""fed"" to us as viewers. 

Does anyone else feel this way, or is it just me? I'll still watch the show and love it but...I don't know, overall I have to say I enjoyed the first few seasons significantly more than this one. "

6,1,The Red Woman,"The scene where Brienne runs into sansa and theon was very encouraging.

An issue that I've started to take with the show is that i think it needs to get on with things a bit more there's too many stagnant story lines. The scene where Brienne meets Sansa is going to fix that for at least a few characters. Sansa has been a sniveling victim for too long, Theon has been a damaged crazy person for too long, Brienne has been wandering for too long and in 1 scene we see all 3 of them make some progress which makes me hopeful "

You greedy bitch. When did that prince get back to Dorne? I thought he was going to ride all the way to King's landing. Or was that scene on a boat? Still seems odd the Lannisters didn't keep him hostage or whatever.

Happy they moved forward with Snow, glad they didn't wait a while to show if he was dead or not. I'm sure there is still a chance he will be fighting at winterfell, but I appreciate not being left hanging for ever.

Best case scenario, what's the best place for Sansa to be heading too? Doesn't seem like she has any family left, or even a place to call home.

6,1,The Red Woman,I feel really sorry for Gendry because the last two things he has done on the show were have sex with an old lady and then row for 4 seasons
6,1,The Red Woman,Are we just gonna ignore how great the Dothraki banter was?
6,1,The Red Woman,"My reactions: 

1. Overall, I feel like there's a much more lighthearted and even humorous approach, that I think comes from the writers directing it more now. From Davos's crack about mutton (something I can't picture book Davos saying (he would have reached for his fingerbones only to become depressed and reflective when they weren't there)), to Tyrion's joke about Varys (I feel like Tyrion normally makes darker, more bitter jokes (although it may just be because his character is in a different situation now)), and so on and so on. 

2. I'm gonna miss Aero, even though they never did anything with him in the show. I loved him in the books. Even though his chapters were few and far-between, he was such a badass with an awesome perspective. He will be missed.

3. Idk about cersei's reaction. I kind of expected her to scream at jaime. I think her character is legitimately changed by the sparrows locking her up (possibly a good thing?) and it's gonna be interesting. 

4. Overall pretty great.  

5. Edit: I forgot to say that I think that when they show Ollie they're making him purposefully even more hateable. Maybe cause he's gonna die soon and they don't want us to feel bad for a kid? I hope so. I hate that kid."

Edit: Also, because there wasn't any discernible animosity between Melisandre and Ser Davos, is it safe to assume that Davos doesn't yet know the circumstances behind Shireen's death or is he maybe suppressing his anger towards Melisandre in order to address the more pressing matters at hand?"
6,1,The Red Woman,"Oh Melisandre. I feel so vindicated. I told my family that she had to be an extremely old hag that was using magic to appear young and attractive.  Ever since the bathtub scene in The Shining, I've been mentally scarred and extremely wary of attractive, magical women who are all too eager to get naked."

6,1,The Red Woman,Why are the Dothraki stereotypical frat boys? 
6,1,The Red Woman,"What we learned this episode:

* Hypothermia isn't a thing.

* It's customary to have your loved ones butchered for meat in The North. 

* If you don't constantly risk the lives of your citizens in pointless wars of vengeance everyone will unanimously agree to assassinate you with no dissent at all despite leading your people through several decades of prosperity.

* The Prince of Dorne who was supposedly trained to fight not only turned his back on an enemy, he actually left a corner to move into the center of the room and flank himself.

* Sandsnakes can teleport onto ships

* A woman beating a blind beggar with a stick in the middle of a public street is a normal event in Braavos and doesn't attract any interest. 

* Anyone can pass as a peasant if they wear peasant clothing.  Even if you are dwarf and a bald eunuch and therefore recognizable even to a Blind Arya Stark. 

* Right after the previous leader of the city narrowly escaped being assassinated, it's totally cool to wander the city alone with no guards talking openly about how you are doing it.  Especially when said ruler you are working for is even less popular now.

* Melisandre's necklace makes her young and makes her not young when she takes it off, unless she takes it off to have a bath with Selyse in the room and then it doesn't. 

* Seeing a beautiful woman naked is among the top 5 things, but probably not top 3.

* One hour lasts approximately 47 minutes"

2. The death of the Sand Snakes and Sparrows at the hands of the Lannisters 
3. For Jon Snow to come back to fight the White Walkers (after killing Olly) 
4. For Tyrion to smash the Harpies for Daenerys 
5. For the North to return to the Starks with bloody vengeance

6,1,The Red Woman,"Ok so here are my thoughts on the episode. A little slow, but it is only the first episode after all. I really enjoyed Davos almost acting like a father figure to the nights watch men. Ghost howling was pretty heartbreaking in that scene.

I don't understand why they seem to fuck Dorne up so bad but the way I'm looking at it is that hopefully this means we see much less of Dorne. I still hate the sandsnakes but I get why the people of Dorne are pissed the fuck off. I will say that it was fucking stupid of Trystane Martell to turn his back to his enemy.

I was really expecting to see Theon killed off in this episode, so its nice to see Brienne to the rescue and even pod doing some swordplay ^^^HAR. Not sure what happened exactly to all the dogs and the other Bolton men but whatever, as long as Sansa sees another day I'm pretty happy. 

I feel like Arya's scene was just a big ""oh hey you remember me im blind and still in Braavos"" but whatever. I really hope Waif gets a particularly thin steel tongue from needle. My guess is that one must kill the other to rank up, but I could be wrong.

I wish we got more of Varys and Tyrion this episode. I feel like their screentime was just too short, but maybe thats just because Dinklage and Hill are such fantastic actors with amazing presence. 

I felt like the highlight of this episode was the dothraki dialogue. The ""five best things""part made me laugh (some needed comic relief IMO). I'm super excited to see Vaes Dothrak and how it plays out for her. I liked Jorah and Daario's dialogue a lot and I really hope Jorah doesn't die but knowing this show, he most likely will. 

The last scene was the best. There have been lots of dialogue before with the red woman being much older than she looks so its interesting to see her in her ""true form"". To me it's like her clothing and appearance represents her faith, and now that its stripped off we see her for what she truly is; Weary, confused, and naked (much like myself when I watch a scene with the Sandsnakes). I'll definitely be interested in seeing where Mel goes from here on. I still think that Jon will be resurrected but I could easily be wrong.

Overall I thought it was a decent start to the season and I'm dying for the next episode already. It's a pleasure to be back discussing new episodes with you lords and ladies and I can't wait to see the funny/interesting content that always is posted after a new episode. 

Cheers everyone!

"
6,1,The Red Woman,"Olly looked a lot older this episode.  Killing the Lord Commander must have allowed him to level up.
"
6,1,The Red Woman,"Really thought were were gonna lose Theon at one point.

Then when Sensa and Briene were having their moment, things were finally looking up for both of them. I fully expected an arrow to the neck for one of them.

TLDR this show has ruined happy moments for me."
6,1,The Red Woman,"Somebody guessed it five years ago:
http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/202-books-and-literature/60164024"
6,1,The Red Woman,No banging Kahl widows. Dothraki bro code is something we should all aspire to.
6,1,The Red Woman,Sand snakes now have Littlefinger's teleporter. Fuck.
6,1,The Red Woman,"Weeks of twitter hype: ""You are queen of NOTHING!"" Oh man, she's really in trouble in ep01.
""A widow of a khal? No man shall touch you."" Okay, crisis immediately averted."
6,1,The Red Woman,I would have liked it if Doran caught on but was too late. Betrayal is so much better when you think the guy you are rooting for has a chance.
6,1,The Red Woman,"Why is no one talking about how Sansa had that ""I'm sick of this shit"" look and now looks like someone about to take over the kingdom?"
6,1,The Red Woman,"I got goose bumps when Sansa swore the oath with Brienne. I thought, the Boltons don't know it yet, but Sansa just stood up and claimed the North for herself. Sansa Stark is the true Ward of the North, and she's fucking coming for you, Ramsay!"
6,1,The Red Woman,"""It's a bloody woman.""

Cue Howard Dean scream from Brienne. ""Hyahhhh!""

Best scene ever."
6,1,The Red Woman,I refuse to believe that the mighty ruler of Dorne only had one loyal guard at his side while the bitch king Joffrey hated by everyone in the seven realms still had hundreds of guards loyal to him. 
6,1,The Red Woman,So Arya is becoming HBO's Daredevil now.
6,1,The Red Woman,haha whoosh
6,1,The Red Woman,Pod The Rod out here swinging steel like it's his dick in a brothel!
6,1,The Red Woman,I am all for Ser Davos being the star of Season 6 if possible after this premiere. Can't wait to see what goes on at Castle Black with Melisandre. Make those traitors pay.
6,1,The Red Woman,The Roose has been angered. I can't wait for us to see his true scary side. Even Ramsey had his Oh shit look on his face. 
6,1,The Red Woman,It's a good thing Jon didn't smash.
6,1,The Red Woman,Did anyone else think at first that the reflection of ol' lahdee Mel was a vision of Daenerys? It made me extra confused when the camera cut back to Mel as an old. 
6,1,The Red Woman,"""I am not blind, nor deaf. I know you all believe me weak, frightened, feeble. Your father knew me better. Oberyn was ever the viper. Deadly, dangerous, unpredictable. No man dared tread on him. I was the grass. Pleasant, complaisant, sweet-smelling, swaying with every breeze. Who fears to walk upon the grass? But it is the grass that hides the viper from his enemies and shelters him until he strikes.""

So much for one of the most interesting future plotlines..."
6,1,The Red Woman,Kit Harrington was among the 5 best actors in that episode.
6,1,The Red Woman,I think it goes without saying but fuck the sand snakes 
6,1,The Red Woman,"The part with Khal Moro. ""Disrobing a beautiful woman for the first time is among the five best things in life"".

It reminded me of that Monty Python sketch. ""Among our chief weaponry are fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency and almost fanatical devotion to the Pope"""
6,1,The Red Woman,#TEAMBRIENNE

6,1,The Red Woman,"Know what? I'll take the horse and the mutton, you can keep the red witch."
6,1,The Red Woman,They totally fucked up Areo Hotah. He shouldn't have gone out like that.

6,1,The Red Woman,"The head of Doran's guard, Areo Hotah, is supposedly one of the best fighters in the 7 Kingdoms. He gets dropped by an aluminum foil toothpick and doesn't say a word or fight back. 

His cripple prince manages to wheeze out several lines after taking one straight to the heart. 

EDIT: I understand the producers are trying to speed things along, but this certainly isn't the way to best utilize several characters with great potential. "
6,1,The Red Woman,[deleted]
6,1,The Red Woman,Arya going full daredevil 
6,1,The Red Woman,Seriously great episode minus Tristan trusting his cousins to be honorable in killing him. Why would you EVER position yourself between two enemies holy shit fighting 101
6,1,The Red Woman,"Tyrion, did you leave the stove on?"
6,1,The Red Woman,I didn't know The Khals were such bros. They were not like that in the first season. 
6,1,The Red Woman,Dorne is a mess. How did two Sand Snakes end up on the ship in King's Landing?
6,1,The Red Woman,"""She thought you wanted to eat her baby"". Hilarious!"
6,1,The Red Woman,Arya is the next Toph Beifong

""...and men, you homophobe"""
6,1,The Red Woman,Thanks god Gendry gave The Sand Snakes a lift or they would never caught up with Trystane's boat
6,1,The Red Woman,"Okay super crazy theory but what if Melissandre is Nissa Nissa and the legends were false. The red god worshippers do have the power of resurrection and although the story goes Azor Ahai pulled his burning sword from his wife's chest, there isn't any evidence that Nissa Nissa died from that, right? She could've easily been brought back with their god's powers especially since the promised prince just got his holy magic sword thingy. Now what if Nissa Nissa never died, but Azor Ahai did, and she had the ability to live longer in order to keep the story and the religion alive in hopes of finding the next promised prince to bring back her one true love. Hence the old hag at the end. "
6,1,The Red Woman,"That glimpse of Olly was enough to make me hate him even more than I did before 

#FUCKOLLY"
6,1,The Red Woman,"Oberyn was clearly not in charge of combat training in Dorne, nor did Trystane share Oberyn's teacher. NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON AN ENEMY TRYSTANE, COME ON!

Even if the Sand SNAKES decided they were in a sporting mood, did you think Obara was just going to sit there and let you kill her sister? Jeez. You earned that one bro."
6,1,The Red Woman,"Fuck man, it'd be so chill to shoot the shit with Khal Moro and his boys for a few hours. "
6,1,The Red Woman,The night is dark and full of wrinkles.
6,1,The Red Woman,I thought Colin Kaepernick's cameo as Khal Moro was awesome.
6,1,The Red Woman,"Davos is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters in this show. 

Not like he was bad before, but I really enjoy them giving him some more screen time, and hopefully he'll become an even more important character. "
6,1,The Red Woman,Gendry's arms must be real tired after rowing that boat for 3 seasons
6,1,The Red Woman,"""Mhysa means mother.""

Melissandre goes to sleep and doesn't do shit"
6,1,The Red Woman,"Dothraki - I wanna see a woman with white pussy hair. 

Me - Me too!

Melisandre - Okay, cool. Here."
6,1,The Red Woman,Fuck dorne and its shitty dialogue
6,1,The Red Woman,My first shitty theory of the season: Is it possible Mellisandre is the witch that gave Cersei the prophecy and has used magic to make herself young? 
6,1,The Red Woman,"It broke my heart when was Cersei was so giddy to see her daughter, after to what she's been through, only to see her dead :(  "
6,1,The Red Woman,"Do people discuss things in this thread or just point out stuff like ""Lol she was really old""

I'm a bit concerned. We're well out of book territory now, and I don't like where it's going.

We have more crude comments which seem out of place. A lot of the exchange between Dany and her capturers just seemed too modern and crude. Talk about fucking Dany in the ass, talk about the colour of her fanny hair, there was even a ""Yo momma"" style joke thrown in.

The dogs disappeared. It's a stupid oversight, seeing as Ramsay's dogs went from destroying an entire assaulting force (stupid) to now completely disappearing (stupid) I get that animating CGI dogs to realistically fall to a sword blow is hard, but that's what cinematic techniques are for.. It doesn't need to be directly shown but it needs to be explained in a plausible manner, have Brienne do a sweeping sword swing and you can see a man get sliced and HEAR a dog get cut in the same swing, then show the dog bleeding out on the ground next to the man... Done.

Sand Snakes Crew avenging Oberyn by killing his Doran? Yeah so maybe they feel like he takes no inaction, but it's just not plausible. All his guards are on their dime? Or they don't give a shit that Doran's reign has meant peace and prosperity?

Sand Snakes appeared on the ship. There was no set up, no explanation, no hinting. They just came out of nowhere. Did they stow-away? Did they teleport? Did they smuggle themselves aboard? Who knows.

Banter jokes with the Khal. It was done in Monty Python's Life of Brian (What did the Roman's ever do for us?) Same kind of format. But the difference is that one is a world-renowned top TV show with a massive budget and the other is a very funny, very silly comedy.


I'm excited to see the rest of the episodes but I don't think I'll be rushing home and putting everything on hold until it's done. I'm a bit worried, both as a book reader and my housemate (TV only) express the same opinions. It seems everything the show does that the book doesn't is a bit messy and hammy."
6,1,The Red Woman,"I think Davos would make an excellent Lord Commander. I also think that he is going to be more instrumental in Jon's resurrection than the red woman, completing his arc of disbelief to faith. "
6,1,The Red Woman,I'm still sad about Mycella's death.
6,1,The Red Woman,Khal Moro's back and forth with his crew is like dialogue straight out of *Clerks*.
6,1,The Red Woman,"Man that was intense watching Sansa say her oath to Breanne. Sansa finally starting to fill her mother's shoes, and Breanne finally back serving a stark. I hope she's the one who gets to kill Ramsay. "
6,1,The Red Woman,Game Of Thrones: now starring Gollum...
6,1,The Red Woman,How the fuck did the sand snakes get on that ship? They were on the pier when it left Dorne.
6,1,The Red Woman,"That smirk of Olly's face was infuriating. 

But okay season premiere. Nothing outstanding, but it laid the groundwork for the season. I just wish they focused on fewer characters for this episode. "
6,1,The Red Woman,"As soon as we are out of the books, D&D gloss over exterminating a major house in 3 minutes. Perfect."
6,1,The Red Woman,"I'm really looking forward to the Ironborn storyline, because now that Doran's gone, I really got not give less of a shit about Dorne.  "
6,1,The Red Woman,Wtf? Did they really end the episode on granny titties?? 
6,1,The Red Woman,"Ugh never been so angry at the sight of Dany's ships burning up. 

NOW SHE'S NEVER GETTING TO WESTEROS SO THANKS GUYS"
6,1,The Red Woman,"We've long thought that [Certain character's fate](#g ""Jon Snow's going to come back from the dead."")  But what if that last scene augurs something else?  Specifically, [Certain character's fate](#g ""The Red Woman uses a glamour to disguise somebody else as Jon"")."
6,1,The Red Woman,So... Where did the hounds go? After Brienne stormed in? They just disappeared!
6,1,The Red Woman,"""You're not the only ones who owe Jon Snow your life...""

""I'll be back!""

..Queue slaughter of the Knights Watch in episode 2"
6,1,The Red Woman,"They saw that they screwed up the Dorne plotline too much in the last season and just said fuck it lets abandon it completely.

Fine by me but please no more screentime for those awful Sand Snakes!
"
6,1,The Red Woman,**When did Ollie go from 11-18?!**
6,1,The Red Woman,"After 3 seasons of hating on Melisandre, Davos is finally keen to embrace the Red Woman's smoke-death-baby-powers. Let's do this!"
6,1,The Red Woman,If Dany could go ahead and use the Sand Snakes' teleportation plot device then we could have wrapped up Game of Thrones a good 3 seasons ago.
6,1,The Red Woman,"Trystane's death made me saddest :(


An entire bloodline wiped out because of those trecherous kinslaying bitches."
6,2,Home,"Ed is the unsung hero.  He took charge of the Wall when the WIldlings attacked, held shit down at Hardhome, and went to get the wildlings when Davos was protecting Jon's body.

Ed for Lord Commander."

6,2,Home,"I loved the intro, with Bran seeing his father, uncle, and Lyanna. It was a beautiful moment and I deeply appreciated the insight we got in that scene.

Cersei is going to bounce back. Now that Tommen is angry enough, and willing enough, to rule the way a Lannister should rule- she'll teach him to be ruthless to get what he wants.

The girl has no name. She passed her test.

The vampire is dead and this is the start of Ramsay's demise. His greediness is his hubris.

Sansa will rule the North once more.

As for Daavos, what a G. He stuck with it and convinced the old lady to reignite her faith just for a moment, just to try, and it paid off. 

He always comes back. Shoutout to Samwell.

 - Watchu talkin bout Willis!

- So fucking pumped for EURON. I am the storm, and you're in my way.

- WUNWUN is back. Love that Hulk smash.

- ""Fuck the Gods. Fuck them all...I'm not a pious man. Obviously.""

- Roose Bolton dying in the same way he assassinated Robb. I've never wanted Ramsay dead more than now, the mad dog must be put down.

- Tyrion handling the dragons and freeing them had my palms sweaty, arms spaghetti. That alone would have been a climactic scene.

- The Faith is just menacing as fuck and I can't wait to see what happens with them.

- 2 Lords die. 1 Lord rises. I mean holy fucking shit. It's all happening. ITS ALL HAPPENING! 

And one bonus thought: I can't believe Sansa may finally be reunited with her family

Let us not forget how important the Freys are in war time with the Twins and all. Being that he has a well documented cruel streak, I'm surprised he didn't force her into a ""marriage"" and then keep her locked in some chamber. That way he still has the Freys until shot cools down in the North. 

Also no sympathy for Roose, he made his bed. Ramsay killed his other highborn son (not mentioned on the show) so he would obviously do the same to his father and brother. The show makes the characters dumber than the books. First, Prince Tristain turns his back on a bitch with a sharp ass spear, now Roose lets his guard down around the psychotic torturous maniac he raised. I get the show is different and they want to skip shit and simplify because they just added some new characters, but their audience is smarter than that. We can keep up.

Other than that, good job.

“Far away,” Ser Gerold said, “or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn in seven hells.”

“I came down on Storm's End to lift the siege,” Ned told them, and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be among them.”

“Our knees do not bend easily,” said Ser Arthur Dayne.

“Ser Willem Darry is fled toDragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys. I thought you might have sailed with him.”

“Ser Willem is a good man and true,” said Ser Oswell.

“But not of the Kingsguard,” Ser Gerold pointed out. “The Kingsguard does not flee.”

“Then or now,” said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm.

“We swore a vow,” explained old Ser Gerold.

Ned’s wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They were seven against three.

“And now it begins,” said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light.

6,2,Home,"Right here's my slightly tinfoil hat theory regarding Hodor/Willis...

So we see in this episode that Hodor's not always been this way and that he could once talk and think like anyone else. 
He's obviously been brain damaged in some way, and I thought his near sparring with Ned and Benjen foreshadowed how it might've happened (a sparring accident)

BUT 

What if, Bran-style, Hodor was injured by someone because he saw something he wasn't meant to see? This would be such a satisfyingly neat echo to what happens to Bran, someone who his story is so aligned with. AND what if this thing that Hodor saw...was R + L = J? And then Rhaegar smashes Hodor over the head to keep him quiet?
Surely that would be sufficient cause to turn Lyanna against him and force him to kidnap her? And the rest is history.

Perhaps Bran could see all this unfold through the weirdwood.net? He's obviously fascinated by the idea of Hodor being able to talk and might try to find out what happens...

What do people think?"

6,2,Home,"Love this paradigm-changing episode.  After viewing, my thoughts on the ending changed a bit - it's clearly there's not gonna be a climatic battle - it's basically story of the Valyrian Revenge.  Now I subscribe to the theory that Jon Snow, Dany, and Tyrion are all of Targaryen royal blood.  What this episode sets up the end game as:

Jon the King of the Ice and the North will defeat the White Walkers and save Westeros. He will then stay outside the wall and leave the North for Sansa to rule.

Dany will return to Westeros proper on her Dragons and resume the Targaryen Dynasty.  With Jon backing her and living dragons, there's no one dare to oppose her

Tyrion will stay in Essos and unite the land of old Valyrian.  He seemed perfected suited to manage the issues Dany could not resolve. 

Together the 3 remaining Royal Valyrian will rule the world in harmony, while their enemies will each die a horrible death, and everyone lived in peace under the careful watch of the secret service setup by Arya.  The North will be ruled under Sansa with the help of Brienne and Pod. Theon will be her loyal supporter, the new ruler of the Iron Isles.  Everyone lived happliy ever after. No big climatic battle, just the right people doing the ruling.  LOL"

Next scene joining Tyrion and crew he was back to his normal stature with his hands in front of him. As to suggest he was no longer trying to be intimidating and regal.

6,3,Oathbreaker,That fart though
6,3,Oathbreaker,"I'm guessing Shaggydog was already dead (defending Rickon from animals/Boltons. etc.), & the Umbers are using him to not only confirm Rickon's identity but gain the inexperienced Ramsay's trust in restoring Rickon's birthright (confirmed by Ramsay & etc.) while also killing the traitors. They circumvented kneeling and officially swearing to Ramsay, which would not only make their betrayal alright in the eyes of the Gods but a huge middle finger to the Boltons because the Umbers did theirs without being oathbreakers. Puts Rickon in harm's way potentially, but the Umbers might also fool Ramsay by saying to spare Rickon to keep the other houses in line (when in fact they would either support Rickon after the fact or are actually in on the subterfuge)."

6,3,Oathbreaker,"Confirmed: Ser Arthur Dayne was indeed the baddest motherfucker to ever live. 
"
6,3,Oathbreaker,"So, does anyone else think that ""Trickon"" is still happening? I smell a set up. The Umber refused to swear to anything, and says how Jon was leading a band of wildlings south. Yet Jon was in the midst of preparing for an execution, not leading anyone anywhere. Not to mention how Osha and Rickon have not a single mark or bruise or even dirt on them, which they would have after, what...2 seasons of captivity (it was season 3 when they split up at that abandoned farm, I believe). No, I believe this is a huge plot to take down Ramsay."
6,3,Oathbreaker,"Very good episode, all the parts of the North and North related were superb. 
  
The Tower of Joy fight was possibly the best action scene of the entire show in my opinion. That simplistic focus on the actors doing fantastic choreography. Ser Arthur Dayne was famous for his skill, admired by many and was also someone who people have respected and we got literally five minutes of him and we instantly got his loyalty and his humble nature. Also I love how we saw how Eddard was prior to the death of Lyanna; More cocky and arrogant which dies after he returns North.  
  
Jon was fantastic, the wounded nature not only physically but mentally, still recovering from what just happened to him was carried through, he seems broken and that fire inside him is gone. He's distant and is likely going to need another episode or two to become his old self.  
  
I wasn't a fan of the High Sparrow scenes, I never am, this one felt a bit of a repeat of what we get. It's showing his manipulation but again, I could have done without it.   
  
Also, props to the makers for giving us a niiiiiiiice close up of bloating pale Olly face."

I had a lot of respect for Alliser even though he was an absolute prick he stood his ground and was honest about his actions. He was a fleshed out character and a presence that the show will miss.

The storyline at Castle Black has been the most interesting for the past 2 seasons and I'm hoping that Alliser's absence won't hurt it too much."

Bran is basically all of us eager to finally find out if that famous fan theory is right. Then that fucking Max von Sydow Three-eyed Raven motherfucker has to play the role of the mean showrunners and keep us on our toes for at least another week.

The execution scene was powerful. Jon still feels fondness for little Olly. He says nothing, like what he now knows awaits Olly after death: nothing. Jon literally knows nothing and he knows that is what Olly gets. Nothing.

No real bad story lines in this episode.  Really hyped to see the Vale get in on the action.  So far I'm thinking maybe the Bastardbowl starts to turn in Ramsay's favor, then the Vale gets them from behind?

I fully expected Danny at the Dorthraki to be dragged out the whole season, but god damn was that a powerful image to see her in front of that burning building with a kneeling army.

You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sweet sister. You will watch as my dogs devour your wild little brother.

6,4,Book of the Stranger,"This episode did a fantastic job of hyping up future events. Jon and the wildings taking on Ramsey. The Lannisters and Tyrells taking on the Faith Militant. Daenerys and the Dothraki taking on the Sons of the Harpy.

6,4,Book of the Stranger,I'm totally shipping Brienne and Tormund now. Anyone else? 
6,4,Book of the Stranger,"Ok so something about Game of Thrones has been bugging me for a while, and it boiled over for me tonight. I need to vent about Loras Tyrell. 

In the books, Loras is one of the strongest knights in the seven kingdoms. He's in love with Renly Baratheon, and gets very depressed when Renly dies. After his death, Loras goes celebate to avenge his love, determined to kill Stannis Baratheon. His face gets disfigured by fire during a battle at dragon stone, where he nearly took out a hundred men to defeat Stannis. 

In the show, Loras' sexuality defines him, and is plagued by gay stereotypes. Renly dies, and Loras can't stop hanging around the male whore house to cope with his loss. His promiscuity is so strong, that he gets arrested by religious zealots over his unnatural behavior. This past episode, his tortire and imprisonment has driven him insane, and he's unable to take the punishment anymore. 

Why did the show have to make him so weak, so promiscuous, and so shallow?  I want Loras from the books, where being gay was a small part of a warriors life. Not a bar fly on cedar springs looking for his next penis."
6,4,Book of the Stranger,Looks like Tormund wants some of that Tarth ass.
6,4,Book of the Stranger,"Tormund Giantsbane eyeing up Brienne like *hey beautiful, wanna hear a story about the time I fucked a bear?* and Brienne looking back like *I don't really have great personal experiences with bears so let's not and say we did*."

6,4,Book of the Stranger,"Is it just me, or was Dany showing a little Targaryen Madness there?"
6,4,Book of the Stranger,BURN BABY BURN
6,4,Book of the Stranger,"I must say, I loved the heartwarming Jon-Sansa moment at the beginning of the episode.

Especially since I was watching GoT with my sister and we went through a rough patch a couple of years ago."
6,4,Book of the Stranger,Sansa and Jon seeing each other again is so heart warming and satisfying.
6,4,Book of the Stranger,"I'm so overwhelmed.... But just keep thinking, Brienne and Tormund are the new Game of Thrones power couple. "
6,4,Book of the Stranger,"The High Sparrow must have known Tommen was going to spill the beans to mommy dearest.  I can't help but think it's a trap to force their hand.  I mean the man literally transcended the pussy to get where he is today, we know he must be enlightened as fuck. "
6,4,Book of the Stranger,Fucking hell does this season make up for how slow last season was 
6,4,Book of the Stranger,I loved how Ramsey peeling the apple symbolized the flayed men. Thought it was super symbolic.

6,4,Book of the Stranger,"Tyrion is preaching to a deaf audience.  Those who follow Dany do so with a cult-like attitude, they are unable to understand that Dany's style starts wars, while Tyrion's ends them.  "
6,4,Book of the Stranger,"Moro, are you wearing aftershave? 


No, it's kerosene. The whole building is soaked in it.


Who would soak a building in kerosene?"
6,4,Book of the Stranger,"Ugh, it feels like dany has had the exact same plot line every season.

Starts off in a terrible, disadvantageous position, with no positive solution in sight, but then outta fuckin nowhere she's suddenly super powerful and strong and sweeps everyone else, because dragons son. Seriously, it happened with her walking into the fire season one, then getting her dragons to carry her out of the warlock tower in qarth (also those guys have joined gendry on the SS abandoned plotlines), then getting control of the unsullied,then escaping out of the fighting pits on drogon, and now tipping over a brazier to get an army.

It's like the writers are trying to disguise her OPness by throwing her a minor setback every so often (except her son drogo and his son dying, thats the only legit bad thing that's happened to her and wasn't magically resolved. Sons of the harpy will probably sort themselves out with tyrion though.)

It was cool the first time or two, but now it's just getting tedious. I get that dany is supposed to be powerful and all, but characters that always get their way get boring fast (*cough cough* ramsay and 20 goodmen *cough cough*).

I did enjoy seeing tyrion apply some logic to the shitshow that is mereen. So far i really wasn't enjoying that plotline (especially since they stupidly killed one of my favorite characters, barristan), but some sleazy tyrion politics could make even dorne interesting.

Ramsay's plot armor is now a full mecha, which grows in power every episode. I'm excited to see the knights of the vale in action, and i can only pray to the old gods and the new that ramsay doesn't pull some bullshit maneuver again."
6,4,Book of the Stranger,"Anyone strangely surprised/impressed with the comedy aspect of the episode?? Daario and bantin it up, as well as his and old man jorahs pink panther moment, Tyrion was pretty funny, tormand eyeballing the maiden fair brienne. "

6,5,The Door,"So Willis was aware of his death at a random point in his youth. That makes the simpleton hodor into one of the most complex characters in the series in my books.

6,5,The Door,"I'm starting to think that Arya will not complete her training and end up running away from the Faceless Men.  She seems disenfranchised with killing good/innocent people and obviously still has problems being ""no-one"" as seen during the play.  ""A girl must decide if she wants to serve the many-faced god.""  ""A girl has decided"" almost makes it sound like she has decided to not serve.  Technically not a lie so Jaqen wouldn't be able to tell."
6,5,The Door,"What a great fucking episode.  Every scene was crucial to plot advancement, and the writing and acting were excellent and full of emotion.  Fuck, this season is great.

6,5,The Door,"I think many of us foresaw that Bran would end up being the cause of Hodor's condition, but I never imagined such a sad end for him.  RIP.  He held the door.
  
A very fast-paced episode generally with lots of action.  I've given up complaining about Littlefinger's jetpack because it meant we got to jump straight to his very meaty scene with Sansa.  I'm not on board with her lying to Jon...  But I am on board with her not trusting Littlefinger.  She was right: he was either an idiot or an enemy.  
  
Disappointed that we didn't get to hear some of the better lines from the Kingsmoot, but it was carried out with admirable economy.  Great to see Theon and Yara fleeing *together*.  Where will they go?  Will they try to get to Dany first?
  
Very interesting scene with Kinvara, Varys and Tyrion.  Did she see what happened to Varys in the flames?  I like that Varys brought up Stannis.  Tyrion keeps on trying to spin things, but Varys has good reason to question the Red Priests' competence and methods.
  
Love, love, loved the play.  Felt the same as Arya watching it.  That's some pretty rough spin on Tyrion.  Kinda reminds me of Shakespeare.  Was Richard the III's character twisted like Tyrion's was here?  Due to Arya knowing that Cersei, Ned and Joffrey's characters were quite different in reality, and Tyrion wasn't actually at her father's execution, she'll probably doubt that how Tyrion's depicted here is accurate - but I wonder if she'll read his marriage to Sansa as actually having happened.  I like Arya questioning the reasons for the actress's assassination.  I wonder if this leads to her breaking away from the House of Black and White or going deeper.
  
The short scene between Dany and Jorah was quite affecting.  :(  Iain Glenn is always great, but when Emilia gets to be a human and not just the Dragon Queen (titles, titles) she can really show intense vulnerability.  Amazing stuff.
  
Great episode.  Nothing wasted.  :)  But Hodor.  :("
6,5,The Door,"Anybody want to go see that new play? ‘Cause I hear the actor that plays Joffrey hangs dong, and I’m very interested in seeing that."

6,5,The Door,[And now his watch is ended.](http://imgur.com/9VptV4d.jpg)
6,5,The Door,"I thought the biggest event of the episodes besides Hodor was the serious threat Euron Greyjoy poses and how easily he could pitch having that big of a navy to Daenerys. 

She'd have a **modern combined arms military** in a time of armies and navy. Dragons (air force and artillery), Unsullied (infantry), the Dothraki (cavalry) and the Iron Fleet (navy). 

She could conquer Westeros **easily** with that kind of military."
6,5,The Door,He held the fucking door. RIP Hodor.
6,5,The Door,That ending hurt my heart. RIP you magnificent beast. 
6,5,The Door,"I think meera has earned the title of ""shittiest life in westeros"""
6,5,The Door,"To those confused about why Hodor's mind fell apart or how it all is linked here is the breakdown:  
  
Bran was in the past looking at events and while there he can influence things. This was shown when he called out to a young Ned Stark and Ned turned around. So while in the past he hears Meera calling to him that he needs to wake up. They need Hodor (she remembers when Bran warged into Hodor and controlled him). Rather than leave, however, Bran decides to warg into past Hodor to gain control of present Hodor's body. It still carries over. However this now links past Hodor's mind with present Hodor's body. So, when Hodor get's stabbed to death the last thing on his mind before he dies is Hold The Door. This carries over to past Hodor as his last thoughts as well since they're linked BUT this whole situation is kind of a paradox that shatters his mind even more causing him to lose a functioning vocabulary until all he holds on to is ""Hodor"".
  
  
  
This is the whole, chicken and the egg conversation. What came first, his body dying or his mind shattering? Technically his mind shattered when he was young but that was only because his body shattered when he was older while Bran was warged in him.
  
  
So, in the end we can all agree that Bran killed Hodor, both mentally and physically."
6,5,The Door,"Fuck 2016

1. Bowie
2. Prince
3. Hodor"
6,5,The Door,Every scene with the white walkers is so unsettling. Love it. 
6,5,The Door,"Honestly, the Hodor Scene is probably the most emotional death since Ned died. That was fucking tragic, this also exposes that they can warg into people in the past but the results are less than pleasant. 


This also confirms my theory that while yes Bran is warging into people, that he has ALREADY done this more than once, he will do it again because the past is as ""good"" as it could have turned out at least in direct relation to Bran and his Family."
6,5,The Door,You get so invested in the different houses and the politics of Westeros and then that final scene shows just how irrelevant it really is
6,5,The Door,"""Hold the door""  Fuck. Someone hold me please. I'm having Red Wedding feels"
6,5,The Door,Hodor slid under the dumpster

6,5,The Door,Hodor.
6,5,The Door,"Do i got this right?

* So Bran jumps back in time.
* Bran wargs into Wyllis.
* Realizes mistake, decides to leave tree-vision.
* Leaves but since he's warged into Wyllis he jumps straight into Hodor's mind.
* Accidentally rips Wyllis's mind forward with him by not leaving him first
* Wyllis isn't trained so he can't leave the present when Bran jumps back and his mind dies with Hodor.
* He only comes back when Hodor dies and so that last fleeting memory is all that comes back into Hodor's blank slate of a mind"
6,5,The Door,HODOOOOR NOOO

6,5,The Door,Does anyone else think Sansa is pregnant with a Ramsay monster?
6,5,The Door,"In today's episode... we see Littlefinger and Varys, arguably the 2 biggest players in the Game of Thrones.. getting wrecked by women. 

also, Hodor's destiny was basically do protect Bran until the last second... it was like seeing a prophecy being told and fulfilled at the same time."
6,5,The Door,Most heartbreaking death of the series. He held that door like a champ

6,5,The Door,That Sansa Stark actress from Bravoos was FIIIIIINE.
6,5,The Door,"Is no one gonna mention Meera being a fucking badass and killing a white walker, being a badass and not dying, and being a good friend and not letting Bran die on his own?

Also, I know this is a popular theory on Varys, but now he must be a Targeryan, then it would make sense for a red priest to burn king's blood, and it would explain why Varys seemed less than sympathetic towards the red priest."

6,5,The Door,Someone needs to get ghost and find nymeria in the riverlands and wrap them up in cotton wool ASAP
6,5,The Door,It's quite possible now that Hodor knew who Bran was all along and still helped him get to where he needed to be. Hodor might be the most honourable character in the show.
6,5,The Door,"beginning : why is the episode called the door wtf?

ending : **WTF**"
6,5,The Door,"This show has had: murder, rape, genital mutilation, burning alive, flaying alive, head smashing and pregnant women being murdered at their wedding.

6,5,The Door,So did they really just explain away the ancient evil which threatens the world in three goddamn seconds?
6,5,The Door,"That ending was heartbreaking. That many deaths and we're only halfway.

* Found it hilarious Jorah was still hopeful of a reply when he said I love you.
* Bran was too bloody eager! He's caused all of the shit that went down towards the end. But at the same time could you blame him? He's literally got the world at his feet perhaps the 3ER should've given him more freedom.
* The children of the forest made the White Walkers?! And now they're dead because of them, how ironic...
* The truth about Hodor is so painful, Bran basically caused him brain damage.
* Another direwolf down (ಥ﹏ಥ) #StopTheDirewolfAbuse2016 I just want them to survive how hard is that?
* Bran's ability to warp time will obviously play a major role but how will he take over the three-eyed raven? Does he need the tree? Will he be constantly warged? Can he survive with just the girl?

Too many questions but that was a good episode. Only bad note is the cgi on the initial bombs which didn't look to good."
6,5,The Door,RIP Hodor & Summer :( 
6,5,The Door,Summer is dead. Winter is coming.
6,5,The Door,"Jesus.  Major, heartbreaking deaths and a hard-cut to a close-up of a flaccid penis.  This is the most Game of Thrones episode of Game of Thrones ever."
6,5,The Door,"Was Littlefinger lying to Sansa about her Uncle having that new refurbished army or whatever?  I wasn't sure if we were supposed to be suspicious of a lot of Sansa's plan relying on that info that she 'stole before escaping Ramsay'.

6,5,The Door,Hodor's really lucky he was so close to being called 'Blentrance'.

*screaming internally* ""YOU happened, you son of a bitch! Don't patronise me""

RIP :("
6,5,The Door,"I cried. Literally left speechless. I guess I never realized how much I valued Hodor until he was gone. He essentially witnessed/heard his own death, those words burned into his mind so that he couldn't could never utter any other word again. Our poor Hodor traumatized until he finally met his fate.

Also, stop killing the wolves!! :'("

6,5,The Door,"Jon Snow resurrected? Reddit survives.

Hodor dies? Reddit commits seppuku and crashes."
6,5,The Door,"Watching Wyllis turn into Hod or and watching what unfolds in the present... this is by the second saddest death I have watched first being Shireen. it seems to me Wyllis also heard, felt, and experienced what present Hodor felt which left him in a crazed deluded state. Hodor is one of the gentlest characters and all he's done was be nice to the Starks. And all he's gotten in return is suffering and misery."
6,5,The Door,Maybe Hodor climbed under the dumpster
6,5,The Door,"I am bawling my eyes out. I never expected this show to reveal such a meaningful answer to such a mysterious character, with such a tragic end. In my opinion, this is one of the most beautiful television sequences in recent history.

Edit: spelling"
6,5,The Door,Holy shit that was one of the saddest episode endings ='(
6,5,The Door,"The White Walkers are a bigger threat than ever.

Bran got marked by the Night King. This allowed the White Walkers to breach the defences of the Children of the Forest and get under the Weirwood tree. If Bran travels past the wall can the White Walkers then breach the Wall?"

6,6,Blood of My Blood,"Jaime is now lord of Casterly Rock and head of House Lannister.  He could not inherit when we gave up his right to lands upon becoming a King's Guard, which would have meant the lands falling to Tommen upon Tywin's death.  However, that was based on Seven Kingdoms' law where a King's Guard was for life.  Now, I would argue that his ""retirement"" places him back in his place of succession, which would mean that he's a Great Lord now.  Tywin wanted him to give up his King's Guard role when he lost his hand, so I have to imagine the legal precedent would work that way.  Not saying he shouldn't be at the head of a Lannister army, but he should be in control of House Lannister now in the process."

6,6,Blood of My Blood,"I feel like the Sam storyline is going to get a lot of hate, but that dining room scene was incredible."
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"[MRW my friend paused it to take a call and said ""You can wait to find out who saved Bran""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6BEdKTGhNg)"
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"In the season finale Benjen and Jon finally get reunited. Everyone is happy. 


And then Benjen stabs Jon. 
""For the watch"". "
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"So pretty much, Arya was sent to kill someone because an actor wanted Cersei's role in the play. Might shed some light on the ethics of the faceless men. Are they taking money/favors for silly death requests?

EDIT: So apparently I missed the whole they are assassins for hire. I thought they were killing people from a higher decree, aka their god wanted the people dead because the people were immoral or guilty of a crime. Sorry!"
6,6,Blood of My Blood,So..... during this episode we saw two sons talking to Walder Frey about the lose of River Run. During the conversation one of the sons mentions that the Brotherhood without Banners were raiding their cargo. Could this be a very subtle hint that Lady Stoneheart is leading these raids on House Frey or am I too quick too jump the gun?
6,6,Blood of My Blood,But the biggest question is HOW DID BENJEN TRANSFORM BACK FROM WOOD?
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"The other Houses, they're laughing at us you have no idea. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have Riverrun but we don't have it anymore. They're laughing at how stupid we are. The Riverlands needs a Lord who can make deals with the Lannisters and the Baratheons. And together, we're going to take back the Riverlands and we're going to Make House Frey Great Again."
6,6,Blood of My Blood,Mildly cold hands
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"EDIT: Imgur Album of the Bran Flash Backs is in the link below, beware spoilers!!!

Hang on, people aren't liking the episode apparently?

* We got cold hands = Benjen confirmed

* Flashbacks to Mad King

* Arya leaving the Faceless Men

* Tommen and the High Sparrow join forces

* Jaime kicked from the Kings Guard, taking charge of a Lannister Army

* Edmure Tully making a return. We are finally seeing Riverrun come into play

* Sam now has a Valyrian sword and is staying with Gilly

* Danaerys riding the Stallion who Mounts the World

Almost every plot got hugely advanced except for Jon's and Castle Black"

6,6,Blood of My Blood,Fuck the faith. 
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"I was expecting Bran to be completely depressed considering what had just happened. They seemed to brush off the Three-Eyed-Raven, Summer, and Hodors' deaths. "
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"I love that everyone in Bravvos are themselves invested in watching Game of Thrones (traveling players edition).  They don't even live in Westeros so it's not like they have a personal stake in the politics; they're just watching the show and rooting for different characters.

I like to imagine they probably talk about it at the literal forum and come up with fan-theories and shit."
6,6,Blood of My Blood,Is anyone else sad we didn't get to see Tormund give Brienne the bedroom eye this week? 
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"Ugh Dany. Let's actually cross the sea instead of talking about it for 5 and a half seasons. 

Glad to see Arya's story is moving forward. 

Should we be worried about Bran's ""burn them all"" visions? "
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"That Dany ending felt perfunctory.  Like they reached the end of the episode and thought ""Shit, we forgot to show Dany tonight"".

EDIT: Look, I'm not saying her giving a speech to the Dothraki doesn't make sense.  I'm just saying the scene didn't really add anything to her storyline we haven't already covered."
6,6,Blood of My Blood,How... How *is* Sam still fat? After ranging north of the wall.. And also being on the wall.  
6,6,Blood of My Blood,Did anyone else feel the khal was really lackluster this episode? They looked like a bunch of (slightly chubby) actors wearing leather. Not too fierce.
6,6,Blood of My Blood,I thought the Arya betrayal of the faceless men was a cool twist I didn't see coming.
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"Can Dany just stop with the hype scenes and get on with it already?! Frfr, just hop on the boat already, you've been saying the same thing since you ate the heart."
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"Brilliant idea Dany, bring a horde of horse riding rapists into Westeros. Then after you claim the Iron Throne, they'll peacefully join civilized society. 

Or they'll raid the country side; burning farms, killing men and raping women."

6,6,Blood of My Blood,"Not that I hate Dany or anything, but I'm fucking sick of her giving speeches and all that stuff. It's becoming annoying at this point."
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"So Sam and Gilly have had quite some time to come up with a plan for her, but never once between the Wall and Horn Hill did it occur to them to make up a backstory for her? She could so easily have passed for Gilly Snow, a girl from Moletown who doesn't know who her father is and therefore will NEVER have to answer any questions about her heritage. What the fuck, Sam?

Arya going back to her IDGAF what anyone else wants, I only do me, MODE is awesome. 
Lannister love is NOT awesome.

Mace Tyrell needing someone to guide his horse, while Jaime rode one handed up f'n stairs was dope. Mace also being the CASUAL viewer, and asking ""what's happening"", was hilarious. 

Daenerys with one of the best promos I've ever seen cut atop a dragon, for REAL. 

Walder Frey being hilarious, as always. Love that evil dude. Does the Blackfish care about his nephew enough to wheel and/or deal with Frey? 

Episode went by so fast, so that means it was great.

""Boats""

6,6,Blood of My Blood,"Jaquen said to not have Arya suffer? If he truly is no one, how can he have feelings for her to any extent? And why is the Waif so hateful towards her? It seems like a lot of personality for ""no one""."
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"I liked the episode, just as much as I did the others, but I realized watching it that I absolutely don't give a single flying fuck about Sam and Gilly. I mean, Sam was ok while at Castle Black because he was different from the rest of the Night Watch: a cowardly fat intellectual. He was not bad  but he was not a really good character, just an okay one.

And Gilly and her baby have always been boring for me.

Now that they're on their own, Ii really don't care about them, the scenes with them (on the boat or even in his family castle) didn't do anything for me, like they could have shown me a picture of grass for 20 minutes, I would have been just as interested. Sam is surprised that his dad who wanted to kill him still doesn't like him, big surprise...

I can't say Ii don't like Sam and Gilly because they're not interesting enough to be disliked.

However the rest of the episode was awesome as usual: Benjen, Tyrell's fabulous armour, Arya,..."
6,6,Blood of My Blood,Is it some kind of an unwritten rule that every other episode must end with Daenerys giving a speech?

Just bringing thousands of people west so they can rape and pillage as they like.

6,6,Blood of My Blood,"Amazingly satisfying episode. I was genuinely afraid for Bran and Meera until Benjen Coldhands showed up, plus Meera really had me tearing up with her devastation. 

Sam/Gilly plotline was awesome, Sam's mom and sister were lovely! I'm actually a bit sad Gilly won't get to spend more time with them, they could have provided her with some much needed female support. 

Arya is finally Arya Stark again, I was so stoked to see her get Needle back! Good things to come guys :)

Not sure what Margery is playing at... I honestly can't tell if she's being ultra devious and is doing all this for her own benefit, or if she's actually been brainwashed. 

Aaand finally. Walder is back. Stark vengeance is at our fingertips :D

Dany keeps making cool rousing speeches, but I'm still impatient to see her at least get on those damn illusive ships. Euron better hurry up!"

6,6,Blood of My Blood,This was the largest setup episode ever.
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"Oh man, oh man. Tommen's REALLY gotta go. The High Sparrow storyline is more stale than Jorah's greyscale arm."
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"Dany is obviously - by now - the main antagonist besides the Nights King. She is a ""conqueror"" who wants to bring tens of thousands of uncivilized crazy murderers and rapists to the Seven Kingdoms and destroy all the noble houses. To do that she teams up with Euron and the Ironborn. People who are also known for attacking and plundering Westeros. In addition she gets supported by a high red priestess who hopes that her Dragons will cleanse thousands of ""sinners"".﻿"
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"I really think that the flipping between the Mad King screaming ""BURN THEM ALL"" and the images of all the White Walkers/wights was a subtle way of showing that Bran also affected that moment in history too. It's likely the Mad King was seeing the army of Walkers through Bran which caused him to go full on mental like Hodor did."
6,6,Blood of My Blood,"I liked this episode.

Cold Hands was awesome.

I'm probably the minority, but I really liked the faceless men story arc for Arya. I'm intrigued by them, I wanted more.
______________
But my main takeaway from this episode is **this is the beginning of Daenerys' Mad-King story arc.**

The burning of the Khals, Daario looks scared but mainly in awe of her. This episode he is questioning her about her plans, what she will do after she retakes her throne. She doesn't have a good answer and he calls her a conqueror. Then looking at her on the dragon he looked more worried than anything. 

I think Danny is going to get power hungry, blood lust and all that. She will start to live up to her Targaryen name in all the worst ways, but ultimately she will have her redemption moment.

This could be a short or a long story arc, not sure what it will be. If it's short, it could just be filler for her for the rest of the season and Tyrion can show her how to rule properly and they never have Danny do anything unforgivable. 

But I think it would be more interesting if it's a long, endgame type of arc. She truly becomes a villain, feared and hated by all. But maybe something causes her to have a change in heart and she sacrifices herself to save the world from the white walkers. 

**Danny = Darth Vader.**  They start off good-hearted, but naive. Gain tremendous power, then let that power go to their head. They become evil, but in their final moment sacrifice themselves for the greater good."

6,7,The Broken Man,"Anyone else see Riverrun and think"" bout damn time one of these castles had a sweet ass mote.""?"
6,7,The Broken Man,"The episode opens on a sunny hillside in the Riverlands, where happy and industrious people appear to be building a wooden sept. Everyone is cheerful and committed. This is remarkably jarring, since it has been a long time since there was a scene like this in this dark world. Alas, it is not a moment that lasts very long.

**LEADERSHIP**

Robb’s rash decisions split the north, and his great failure is referenced several times. He is also described as missing a head (“the broken man.”)

Ten-year-old Lyanna Mormont is a wise and decisive ruler, and absolutely commands a room full of powerful adults.

Jon uses his own integrity to earn the trust of the Free Folk, and of Wun-Wun, although he is greatly assisted in this by the leadership skills of Thormund, who notes that “Jon died for us” (""The Broken Man."") Similarly, Jon and Sansa both need the leadership skills that Davos learned from his many years of gaining the trust of a royal child.

The Brotherhood Without Banners may have a new leader. This is does not seem to be Beric’s Brotherhood. Perhaps their Red Priest Thoros will revive the Septon to demonstrate their power. We might at least dimly hope for this, because it would be great for Ian McShane to be awesome for more than a single episode, and because we were given a tease with his line to Sandor: ""It's never too late to come back.""

We do however, see the Septon clearly and unambiguously hanged, slack-jacked, eyes bulging, and being very, very still (“The Broken Man.”) Of course, Edmure was about to be hanged, then released, then about to have his throat cut, and he didn’t die in either case.

**THE GAME OF THRONES**

Baelish appears to be controlling Sansa, who secretly writes a letter to someone after Jon’s insists against her wishes that they march to attack Winterfell immediately. That Jon does this is Baelish’s plan all along, since he wants to appear at the last minute and save the day with the Knights of the Vale.

Margery slips Olenna a scrap of paper on which she drawn a rose, the Tyrell family symbol. When we first met Olenna several seasons ago, she confessed to Margery how much she loathed seeing that rose on everything. In this case, she is clearly relieved to know that Margery is playing everyone.

**BROKEN THINGS**

The ancient vassalage of House Glover to House Stark is broken (“The Broken Man.”)

The trust between Sansa and Jon seems to be at least somewhat broken as well, since Sansa is secretly working a game behind his back.

Brynden “The Blackfish” Tully refuses to relinquish Riverrun to save the life of his nephew Edmure. Blackfish apparently finds Edmure unworthy of such a concession, an echo of the embarrassing moment at the funeral of Hoster Tully (Brynden’s brother and Edmure’s father), when Edmure repeatedly failed to ignite the funeral barge with a flaming arrow and Brynden had to step in to do it for him. There is much guilt here as well, since it was Brynden who ordered Edmure to marry the Frey daughter at the Red Wedding. Bryndan himself only escaped that massacre because was relieving himself outside. His giving up on Edmure is harder than his stony face might suggest. He brags that he has two years of food, and he doesn’t care how many people die over the castle, although his determination seems joyless and bitter since he has lost everything else (“The Broken Man.”)

The burning hatred that Cersei and Olenna have for each other might well have been set aside in some other story. In “Game of Thrones,” however, there is no making up and there appear to be no happy endings. Olenna never considers even for a second anything proposed by Cersei, even it might help her save her own family.

The Waif directly disobeys Jaqen, breaking her vow to the Many-Faced God. Jaqen had specifically ordered the Waif to assassinate Arya without suffering. Not being a girl who has no name either, the Waif instead purposefully wounds Arya in a way to prolong her suffering.

Broken faith is demonstrated for different reasons. Margey offers “seven blessings” to her grandmother, not believing in them but pretending to do so. Septon Meribald greeted the Brotherhood with “seven blessings” as well, not believing in them but setting an example that everyone ought to try to believe in them.

**BROKEN THINGS THAT ARE HEALING OR MENDING**

The vassalage of House Mormont to House Stark is renewed, although only with 62 men.

Using a rehabilitation technique based on drinking ale, Yara obtains from Theon a commitment that he will fully heal himself, to refuse to live his life as a “Broken Man.”

The support of the Wildings and Wun-Wun for Jon Snow are renewed.

Sandor, wounded so badly he was taken for dead (“The Broken Man”) has recovered somewhat, given up his days of war and violence, and seems to genuinely be trying to live an ordinary life. However, once the Brotherhood appears, his warrior instincts kick in. He is reborn as a man with an axe, and he knows how to use it.

**ISOLATION THEME**

Cersei has only the Mountain. As Olenna points out, she has nothing else, no allies, no resources, no champions.

Sandor once again is a man alone.

Arya is grievously wounded in a foreign city.

Theon must endure an evening in a brothel, which makes him miserable. He is left alone by his sister, who seems quite delighted to be there.

**WINTER IS COMING**

The trees at Riverrun and Bear Island have already shed their leaves.

Davos warns Lyanna Mormont that she cannot face the Night’s King alone, and that the dead are indeed coming.

**ELEMENTAL REFERENCES**

Water: Arya jumps in water to escape the Waif. Blackfish’s armor is scaled like...well, like a black fish. Margery and the High Sparrow recite and interpret a passage about water flowing over stones.

Wood: The Septon and the Hound are building a wooden sept.

Blood: Arya bleeds out in the water and in the marketplace.

Paper: Margery tears a corner from a page in the Book of the Seven, conceals it from the High Sparrow and later from the Septa, and then uses it to give a secret message to Olenna.

Steel: The Septon tells the Brotherhood he has no steel. Now wearing his family’s armor for the first time in many years, Jamie again goes for the full royal pageantry: his armor features at least three images of the family lion and plenty of gold embellishments.

**BEST LINES**

Technically speaking, every line Bronn has is a best line, so just for example we’ll go with his comment to Jaimie, who about to recite the family motto: “Don’t say it. Don’t *** say it.”

Septon: “In the time I’ve got left...” and “I’ll hear her screaming for the rest of my life” foreshadow his death.

Olenna to Cersei: “I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.""

Cersei to Olenna: “That's all the truth I know,” a reference to the “The Rains of Castamere,” the song about her family’s legendary strength and brutality.

"
6,7,The Broken Man,No one's talking about how Tommen cried to the High Sparrow because Margaery wouldn't do the horizontal hokey-pokey?
6,7,The Broken Man,"I thought it was interesting how the end of the episode in many ways mirrored the events when Arya left Sandor for dead. The situation is now somewhat reversed - Arya has a potentially fatal wound if she does not find help (which could happen based on the look of disinterest from the people around her currently, even while seeing her bleeding), whereas Sandor clearly has revenge on his mind and will set out to claim it, much like Arya did when she left The Hound.

Another nice touch I enjoyed was the look of panic on Arya's face. It was more than a look of 'please help me, I'm dying' - you could see she was paranoid and cautious. She looked into every face - and you can understand why she would be so scared since the Waif could feasibly be any one of the faces in the crowd. It's compelling stuff - if and when Arya does find someone to help, she might even push them away for fear of it simply being the Waif looking to finish the job.

Great episode, all told, and as usual I can't wait to see the next!

Predictions for next episode:

* Sandor destroys the brotherhood raiders but meets with Thoros / Beric and they choose to spare him and recruit him into the fold.
* Arya will get assistance from Jaqen after mistakenly seeking help from the Waif in disguise and killing her in panic. Jaqen will consider the debt paid at this point and save her life, but allow her to return home with no threat of any revenge.
* We'll catch up with Branjeneera as they find another Weirwood and we will see more ToJ among other visions
* Sam will reach the citadel and be accepted as a maester in training, perhaps after showing his house blade and recounting how he has killed a White Walker (the maesters will be aware of the history and I'm sure they would be wise enough to understand the importance of Sam gaining knowledge)
* Too early for bastardbowl, so we perhaps won't see much of Jon and Sansa, but instead get a scene of the ironborn setting sail across the sea to Dany, with a counter scene of Euron preparing his new fleet. I imagine Euron also has a few tricks up his sleeve to level the playing field - I'm sure I've read Kraken mentioned before in reference to visions of a bloody sea and a 10 limbed monster rising from the waves. While this might be pure metaphor it would be amazing to actually see a Kraken - can you imagine a battle between a Kraken and Drogon? Holy crap!
* At the wall we might see glimpses of a white walker scout, signifying that the army is approaching ready for the battle and eventual collapse of the wall (episode 9 or 10)"
6,7,The Broken Man,Brynden Tully's armour looks so cool. He's called the Blackfish so his armour is black fish scales and they also (the scales) have a hint of brown. Best armour in the show so far in my opinion.
6,7,The Broken Man,"I'm just re-watching this episode today and I realised that Theon is going to Mereen... where Tyrion is.

 Their last conversation wasn't so civil, the impending conversation will be amazing. 

That being said, Tyrion has a special place in his heart for 'cripples, bastards and broken things'. 

This is going to be so fucking good."
6,7,The Broken Man,"After this episode I'm completely sold on never seeing Daenerys again, this was the most solidly entertaining episode in forever."

6,7,The Broken Man,"Oh, I was sold on Margery being truly converted when she started reciting the Bible of the Seven Gods. I almost cheered when she gave the paper to the Queen of Thorns. 

She's hands down the best player in Kings Landing and is/would be a better Queen than Daenerys.

6,7,The Broken Man,"As soon as I saw the old lady I was like: ""OH SHIT ITS THE WAIF, RUN ARYA!"" Then I proceeded to freak out."

6,7,The Broken Man,"Jaime: ""you (Bronn) got more smarts than any many in this (Lannister p) army""

6,7,The Broken Man,Soon we will be seeing Theon join Dany's long list of dickless allies.
6,7,The Broken Man,"I don't really understand why the Brotherhood attacked the group.. I thought they were 'for the people' and against the big families etc.

***BURN THEM ALL***

EDIT: So I stop getting a million replies, the rumor is supposedly about the remaining caches of Wildfire that Aerys Targaryen hid underneath King's Landing.  His plan was to burn the city down and was in the process of having his pyromancers light the stores when he was murdered by Jaime.  Jaime killed him to save the city

Idk how much it's been touched on in the show, but in the books even Tyrion wasn't able to uncover all the caches when he accumulated the wildfire for the Battle of Blackwater

6,8,No One,The Blackfish dialogue was really odd. He reminded us at least 6 times of the red wedding and who died. Are people really that fookin' casual that they can't remember the biggest event in the show? They also name-dropped Catelyn and got us hyped only to dash it in our faces.

6,8,No One,Anybody else get a fatherly vibe from Jaqen H'ghar? The way he smiled at the end made me feel like he did all of that just to prepare Arya.
6,8,No One,"Tommen is far from the most evil but I wouldn't mind if he died a terrible death for cancelling Cleganebowl and derailing the Hype Train.

Jon: Hey Ramsay, actually.. I think I've changed my mind! Instead of fighting, why don't we just have a pint? Or maybe I'll just forfeit the siege afterall. We've had too much action lately, shall I come back next season?

Ramsay: Hell naw mate, come 'ere I'll bash ye head in

Jon: Alright then, as you want, but come stand here - there's a camera there you wouldn't want to fight on screen

6,8,No One,[deleted]
6,8,No One,"RIP Lemon Cloak, we barely knew ye. "
6,8,No One,"Okay, so... in some ways I'm glad that a few of the elaborate theories were killed brutally. Cleaganbowl=dead Blackfish siege and conflict between Jaime and Brienne=dead. Both aspects were killed so QUICKLY that it's kind-of fitting for game of thrones and I can at least find humor in that simply *because* it's so surprising.

But I'm very disappointed with how the No One aspect ended. Arya was stabbed, healed by Lady Crane, then kills the Waif and Jacquen lets her go... That is about the most uninteresting way for Arya to leave an assassin guild that can be literally anyone. And what skills did she pick up for her trouble? Fighting in the dark is about all I can think of. And getting pummeled. I feel like her arc was leading up to something really big and interesting--and then there's no delivery! Arya leaving feels more like ""ugh, finally"" than ""what a badass way to leave and what cool stuff she's learned!"""
6,8,No One,"If we've learned anything from Gendry, we may never see Brianne and Pod again for a long long time. "

6,8,No One,No One saw that ending coming
6,8,No One,"Was anyone else disappointed that Arya was actually that dumb in the last episode, walking around in the open, unarmed when she knew the Faceless Men would be after her?"
6,8,No One,So what's the crazy theory of this week? The waif's dead face is actually Blackfish in disguise or that Pod is Syrio in hiding waiting for Arya to return to Westeros?
6,8,No One,Ugh that whole Tully plot felt so pointless...

6,8,No One,RIP LADY CRANE
6,8,No One,"Am I the only one who doesn't understand the hype for cleganebowl? Is it Sandor's revenge everyone wants to see, or just two big dudes having it out?"
6,8,No One,"Game of Thrones romance 101 - 
1. You take one hand and put it on the back of her head, nice and romantic, women love that.
2. You take your other hand and put it on her lower back, like this. 
3. AND THEN YOU SHOVE YOUR FINGER IN HER BUMHOLE"
6,8,No One,"I hope Tommy boy realizes soon that he's a bastard child born of incest like his sister found out. This won't end well for him. The high sparrow has suspicions that he is. If she's found guilty by account he has no right to the throne. Guess who might feel since he's the other pillar might be ready to become king... Oh sparrow you clever no shoe wearing lunatic:P 

Though I wonder what the Kyburns little birds found out?"
6,8,No One,"I know a lot of people feel like the Faceless Men plot was pointless, but I think it actually taught her a lot. Most importantly it taught her that she wanted to be a Stark. After everything she went through in Westeros she was ready to become no one, but after the last few episodes she learned that she wanted to be a Stark, and that she wanted to be in Westeros. She received training, but that was only a small part of what she learned during this arc."
6,8,No One,"Sandor is the hero we need not the one we want. That's why he has to fight the white walkers and not bring hype to cleganebowl

Edit: I am not a smart man."
6,8,No One,"Your waif is shit, confirmed."
6,8,No One,So Arya was much more of an idiot than we all thought with the conspiracy theories. It's fine the writing is fine ^everything^is^fine
6,8,No One,"Alright hold up.  
1. Waif had no right to be mad at Arya for not dying *when she was the one that failed to make sure she had died, and painless at that, in the first place.*  
2. There is no way in seven hells that Arya would be able to run like that after being stabbed multiple times in the gut! Hell after she rolled down those stairs she should have died.  
3. I don't understand how her killing Waif truly made her no one.  
4. I also don't understand how Jaquen Haquar allowed her to just walk away like that. I feel as if he's still gonna come after her.  
5. Any one else feel like the Waif got too easily tricked?

*E:* After reading every comment up to this point, a lot of the reasoning provided make a lot of sense. My comment was sort of a heat-of-the-moment type thing of confusion. My questions have been well thought out by others and answered in some degree now, thanks."

""Lol these Brotherhood were just a few bad eggs. They're mostly still good."" 

D&D really did a troll job. This isn't a criticism so don't attack me. I just don't see how anyone could argue otherwise."
6,8,No One,"Every decision Tommen has made this season really grinds my gears. As the King on the Iron Throne, he might be doing a good job of unifying the country and removing bloodsheed but dammit as a viewer, he just tries and does his best to get in the way of all the things we want most doesn't he?"
6,8,No One,[deleted]
6,8,No One,"Interesting parallel between the pilot and this episode with Jamie saying ""The things we do for love."" I think that is how he justifies the things he does to himself, that it's all worth it for Cersei."
6,8,No One,"2 seasons of Arya training and she learned how to fight in the dark. Meanwhile her sister built an army, her brother knows everything, and her half brother came back from the dead.

At least she isn't rickon..."

6,8,No One,"Is it just me, or did the way that Tirion talked about wanting his own vineyard really sound like he was never gonna get it? I want him to survive and get his goddamn vineyard!"

Why did this take 2 seasons?"
6,8,No One,"Arya's Braavos adventure has been one of the most disappointingly boring and somehow rushed at the same time plotlines in tv. I was so pumped when she got on the boat two seasons ago, what a let down."
6,8,No One,So... What the fuck has Arya been doing for 2 seasons?
6,8,No One,This episode contained 0 fight scenes. Blackfish dies off screen. Danyeres apparently saves the city off screen. Arya kills the waif off screen. What the fuck? 
6,8,No One,King Tommen The Hype Slayer
6,8,No One,A face was added to the wall.
6,8,No One,That has to be one of the worst things to see when you are hanging to death; someone taking your fucking shoes. 
6,8,No One,this show was way better before we passed the books
6,8,No One,[deleted]
6,8,No One,"Does anyone else feel like these blockbuster series are taking the piss a bit ? We get 10 episodes of game of thrones a year and at least 6 of them are set ups. In comparison to Vikings for example , there seems to be a battle scene every other episode. I just feel like we're always waiting for something to happen. If there were 15 episodes a season then 6 set ups would be fine but I personally feel like they're dragging it out to get more money , same as walking dead. Thoughts ?"

6,8,No One,"BASTARD BOWL SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY 

YOU'LL PAY FOR THE ENTIRE SEAT BUT YOU WILL ONLY NEED THE EDGE"
6,8,No One,"Let us talk about Dany showing up for literally 10 seconds and not saying anything and no one talking about the GIANT FREAKING SIEGE HAPPENING!
"
6,8,No One,Anyone else expect LSH to come say hi to the hound at the end?
6,8,No One,"This was definitely the funniest Game of Thrones episode I've ever watched. Also, why couldn't we see Drogon set the Astapori/Yunkish fleet ablaze? That would have been so incredibly badass."
6,8,No One,"Was that the Hound pissing on the theory we'd see LSH this season? That's what it felt like to me, haha."
6,8,No One,"Now people wanna see Tommen dead because he Clegane-blocked us. This show makes us want to see children dead so many times, I feel like Freddy Kreuger."
6,8,No One,"What's up with Jaime telling everyone he fucks his sister, she's about to be on trail for this type of shit."
6,8,No One,"Did anyone else find the **""You're shit at dying, you know that? ""** and the whole scene ridiculously funny. I haven't stopped laughing since last night. I was actually giggling out of control at how funny that was. It is now my favorite TV show quote of all times."
6,8,No One,"This episode fell pretty flat. The chase scene with the waif felt forced and cheesy (lots of dramatic pauses and villainous grins), the off-screen death of the Blackfish was anticlimactic, Danaerys's entrance was classic deus-ex-machina, and that little wave between Jaime and Brienne was just silly. 

Although I am glad we got to see the Hound's penis. That was pretty rad. "
6,8,No One,Fuck Tommen.
6,8,No One,"God damn that Bravos story line really fell flat. All that world building of the Faceless men, and they end up making no more sense than they did when they were first introduced"
6,8,No One,"""I felt a great disturbance in the Hype, as if millions of theories suddenly cried out in terror... and were suddenly silenced"" "
6,8,No One,"Next episode is gonna be hype as fuck. 

This was such a good episode for story development. "
6,8,No One,"Did sexy Jesus plan it this way all along!?

Now we only have the hype of BastardBowl to pull us through the last two episodes."
6,8,No One,"Arya, record holder for fastest mile post gut stabbing"
6,8,No One,Cersi is so pissed Cleganbowl is dead she is going to be using Wildfire to burn the entire city to the ground.
6,8,No One,That ending chase scene felt like it was lifted right about of a Terminator movie.
6,8,No One, Cleganebowl cancelled and Lady Stoneheart denied all in the same episode... a lot of people are returning their tinfoil to the grocery store. 
6,8,No One,Well that was underwhelming. All our speculation about Arya was for nothing. It really was just her being dumb and not expecting the Waif. The whole Faceless Man saga has been a bore. 
6,8,No One,"Did villager killer #1 seriously just say ""Please don't, I'll give you any-"" before dying? Like the Hound is going to consider that request and convince the brotherhood not to go through with the execution..."
6,8,No One,"""I can't go on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city""

""Varys, the most famous dwarf in the world"" 

It was always nice listening to their conversations. I just hope they meet again, but knowing GoT.. I'm afraid they won't :("
6,8,No One,"I like to think there are a few Jaqens around the House of Black and White who take turns in training the Faceless men. The last one just happened to come from his vacation to find a dead Waif and a girl with a sword to his chest. When confronted, he likely said ""...A girl finally is No One"" when thinking ""who the fuck is this person"". Then he let her walk away in completely dazzled by confusion."
6,8,No One,">I've already killed you once Dodarion, don't make me do it again 

I've missed the Hound so much."
6,8,No One,"""I prefer chicken.""

6,8,No One,I'm disappointed Dany came back only because I want to see the Ironborn teach the Masters a thing or two about naval warfare.
6,8,No One,So...Ayra's uncharacteristic behavior last episode was just bad writing. Ok.
6,8,No One,">Those are your last words? C'mon you can do better

>CUNT!

>You're shit at dying"
6,8,No One,"I thought this was one of the weakest episodes in the show's history thus far, to be honest, however I was so pumped to see Beric and Thoros again. For some reason I was afraid they weren't going to follow up on why the Merry Men-esque band of outlaws from season two were now slaughtering religious hippies; there was a part of me that thought that meant we were finally getting Lady Stoneheart, but honestly she doesn't fit with the show's overall story arch and she aint coming. It was just nice to see the Brotherhood Without Banners is still out there being noble and cool."
6,8,No One,"You may be thinking that Cleganebowl hype is dead, Blackfish hype is dead, Arya/Jaquen hype is dead, and Syrio hype is dead but remember: WHAT IS HYPE MAY NEVER DIE.
"
6,8,No One,"So what was the point of bringing back the Blackfish and sending Brienne down to Riverrun? Just to have a scene with her and Jaime that had no plot significance? 

No Arya tinfoil, she was just acting stupid last episode. Fine. 

I still really like this show, and this season is definitely better than season 5, but the writing has just gotten sloppy since they stopped following Martin's material. It's weird too, since D&D wrote some really good stuff in the earlier seasons that wasn't from the books."
6,8,No One,Also really impressed with the writing of Jaime's story arc. He went from the spoiled brat I hated seasons ago to one of my favorite characters this season. He's changed immensely as a character. 
6,8,No One,DAMN TOMMEN DENIED HIS MOMS TRIAL BY COMBAT. SHE IS GOING TO KILL HIM OR BE THE REASON HE DIES 100%. SORRY FOR THE CAPS I'M JUST HYPED FOR THE HOUND.
6,8,No One,Hounds cock. Get hype
6,8,No One,A girl isn't apart of that stupid ass story line anymore. 
6,8,No One,How can this be the same writers from season 1-4? 
6,8,No One,"The Mountain using the classic Pez dispenser move. 

Cleganebowl postponed and/or cancelled. 

The Hound is a chicken man confirmed.

Jaime wild politicking and turning up the sexual tension with Brienne. 

Pod getting his dick grabbed by Bronn. 

Khaleesi installing Uber on Drogon. 

A girl is Arya Stark and the waif is dead. 

What a fucking episode."
6,8,No One,">He's not my friend

Brienne pls :("
6,8,No One,Solid appetizer before the Battle of the Bastards but I really wish we got to see The Waif and Blackfish's deaths.
6,8,No One,Okay Missandei is adorable
6,8,No One,"I laughed so hard when the dude behind the waif just ended up being a random dude. I think fans have gone more and more wild with speculation this season, mainly due to being off book."
6,8,No One,"1. I am continuously disturbed by the bastardization of Jaime's character by D&D.
2. Jaqen looked so proud
3. This might sound kind of cold but if the Blackfish wouldn't drop everything for Sansa, why would Edmure care so much about a son he never met and a wife he met once who (from his perspective) could have been in on the Red Wedding?"
6,8,No One,I should have known Lady Crane was going to be killed when they opened with her giving a really good performance in the play. 
6,8,No One,"You cannot tell me that Jaime and Brienne don't have feelings for each other. ""It's yours. It's always been yours."" That look of longing as Podrick rowed them away. Tormund can't match that. "
6,8,No One,So I guess in the last episode Arya was just being an idiot?
6,8,No One,"I'm still wondering how the hell Arya survived those punctures. That blade had to be 6 inches long, 3 full punctures straight to the gut should've ended her without question."
6,8,No One,"Seriously, no one is talking about how cliche Dani arrival to Mereen was? That entrance with a high degree of ""I am here to save the day, even though I had no idea of how to ride a dragon or anything else, for the last five seasons"" ? No one? Ok."
6,8,No One,The ridiculousness of Arya's storyline really overshadowed the ridiculousness of flaming trebouchets on wooden ships with masts and canvass sails hanging from them.

6,9,Battle of the Bastards,"I know we're all excited about Purina's newest flavor, Flayed Man, but after that I am most excited about Tyrion. 

Here we have a character who has spent the last six seasons being shit on. First he's ignored by his family or imprisoned by Caitlin, then he's deposed as Hand (and all his achievements ignored), thrown in jail, captured by slavers, and then made into a gladiator. All the while, his sage advice is ignored, mocked, or stolen without credit. 

Finally he meets Danerys who takes him on as an advisor. He is left in charge of a foreign city on the brink of collapse previously led by a charismatic, idealistic but inexperienced ruler (more shit to deal with). He doesn't speak the language well, his only friend leaves on his own mission, and his every decision is met with hostility or doubt from his fellow advisors. Meanwhile, he tries to open negotiations with the cities enemies, revitalizes the economy, and swings the people back behind Danerys. 

This all culminates with a siege on the city right when Danerys returns. Ultimately, an attack by the Masters was unavoidable. However, rather than the city being consumed from within by the Sons of the Harpy sowing dissent or from them collapsing the economy, Tyrion forced them to attack in the open where Danerys could actually fight them. As he said, Meeren being successful was an affront to the Masters. 

And what did Dany do? Did she throw him in the dungeon or exile him? No. She did the one thing no leader had done to date: she continued to listen to him. He guided her to a more peaceful path (more peaceful than say razing cities). Tyrion is finally doing what he is good at, advising for a powerful leader and that advice is finally being appreciated. I am very excited to see where the Dany/Tyrion powerhouse will go "

Sansa, you are finally free."
6,9,Battle of the Bastards,"Poor Rickon.  :(  Sansa was on-point about Ramsay's trap.  Jon's reaction was just as she feared, even if it was completely understandable.  
  
The Bolton siege tactics were terrifyingly effective.  Great juxtaposition between Ramsay being willing to fire volleys of arrows into the melee even though it would hit some of their own men and Davos's unwillingness to do so.  And that shield wall.  Nightmarish.  
  
In general, the battle scene was incredible.  Jon being trapped and unable to breathe I think evoked some of GRRM's message that war is not glorious.
  
Wun-wun went out as epically as possible.  So much for a siege.
  
And I'm not sure that Ramsay could have had a more appropriate end."

6,9,Battle of the Bastards,I am more satisfied by this hour of television than anything else in history
6,9,Battle of the Bastards,"I felt more emotion when Wun Wun died than when Rickon died. Rickon's death was just more of the same predictable ""Ramsey being an untrustworthy and sadistic monster"" material we've been getting for several seasons now

To give some props to something I haven't seen mentioned yet, back in Meereen, when the slavers were being all full of themselves about Dany's reign being over, the shot of Drogon swooping down past the great pyramid in the background, right over the slaver dude's shoulder, totally killed me. [A screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/LyKQILR.jpg) doesn't do it justice, but I think the shot deserves some props in addition to the battle of north. "

6,9,Battle of the Bastards,The scene where Jon was being smothered by men retreating/dying basically signified his re-birth. He has been lacking in confidence and purpose since his resurrection and this instance showed his realization that he could give up or keep fighting forward. This time he made the choice to rise up and continue rather than the choice being made for him.

Buuuuuut, is anyone else happy that we got to see Viserion and Rhaegal in action this episode?  Ever since we got the dragons back in season one, Drogon has pretty much been the spotlight, and it turns out that Drogon isn't the only badass dragon...

6,9,Battle of the Bastards,[deleted]
6,9,Battle of the Bastards,"Anyone else was punching the air (with hate) when John Snow was beating Ramsay, "
6,9,Battle of the Bastards,"I thought it was very interesting how much historical inspiration was evident in that episode.

Jon begins by planning to extend his battle line to make up for his lack of numbers and attempt to envelop the Bolton army, as strategy dictates. Davos then mentions weakening the center (like Hannibal at Cannae) so that the line will buckle into a convex shape: historically, the Carthaginian center faded drawing the enemy in while the veteran troops on the flanks held, allowing the smaller army to envelop the larger in the center and on the wings. 

But once Jon's plan goes to shit, he is actually the one outmaneuvered and enveloped by the Bolton's pike phalanx which begins to squeeze the army tight (again just like the Carthaginians at Cannae but roles reversed this time). When Hannibal's veteran wings began to squeeze the overconfident Romans, the Legion's numerical superiority became a weakness and the Roman's formations were compressed so tight that men could not move or fight (some of the inspiration for Jon suffocating under all of the bodies, no doubt). 

Then finally the shock cavalry comes in with their charge bonus and demonstrates the weakness of the phalanx. 
A+ tactics, heroic victory

Historical aside: For the full double envelopment Jon mentions, (the ""pincer"") Hannibal's Numidian cav had to first rout the Roman cav and then return to the battle to envelop the enemy's rear, creating a complete encirclement and preventing retreat."
6,9,Battle of the Bastards,Really hoping to see those disloyal Northern houses get a stern talking to from Jon 
6,9,Battle of the Bastards,"Why wasn't Wun Wun weaponized? A Wun Wun size sword, spear,  tree branch... Literally anything could swing. Dude needed a weapon.  "
6,9,Battle of the Bastards,"That small heart attack you had when the camera angle made you think Tormund was killed, but his arm was sliced."
6,9,Battle of the Bastards,I actually hate Sansa for not mentioning that reinforcements are coming.  So many people died because of her. 
6,9,Battle of the Bastards,I used to be a giant like you... until I took an arrow to the eye.
6,9,Battle of the Bastards,"We all know and love the phrase. The North Remembers. It's hope, it's redemption, it's vengeance brewing beneath a thin film of patience. It's a promise that no matter the atrocities of the world, no matter the oath-breakers and the back-stabbers, the unjust will get their due, in time.

        
But in the end, there was no great Northern Conspiracy. No one there to remember what the Boltons had done. Jon's desperate charge at Winterfell should have been written down in history as a military blunder. But he's saved last-second not by Northernmen, but by knights of the Vale, led by a cunning man from King's Landing. What could have been such a gratifying reveal (I'm biased here, since the Mummer's speech is my personal favorite scene in all the books) was reduced down to yet another surprise charge by some cavalry. It happened before at King's Landing, it happened at Mance's camp, and it happened again at the battle for Winterfell.


The Glovers forgot. The Umbers forgot. The Manderlys were forgotten."

6,10,The Winds of Winter,Sam walking into that library like Belle.
6,10,The Winds of Winter,They managed to find the mopiest baby to be baby Jon. These casting directors get an A+
6,10,The Winds of Winter,The most frustrating thing now that could happen: Brann never tells Jon
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"RIP: Tommen, Margaery, High Sparrow, Loras, Lancel, Mace, Kevan, Pycelle, Walder Frey and the shifty twins (also I guess Lyanna?)

This has got to be the deadliest episode yet for characters with names."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Olenna Tyrell officially fixes every plotline she's involved in.
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Jaime is so going to add 'Queenslayer' to his resume!!
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Totally badass Clegane unboxing video.

"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Loved how Arya killed Walder Frey the same way He killed Catelyn. You reap what you sow I guess.  

Also, Jamie started this whole chain of events by pushing Bran off the ledge and now his son jumped off. Full circle."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,The scene where Tommen is just listening to the screams and then falls out the window... Holy fuck
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Was expecting High Sparrow to walk out, face half burned, adjusting his robes."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.""

Wow. Tyrion was right. Cersei's joy -- her children -- were all turned to ashes."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Haven't seen this mentioned, but props to Liam Cunningham's acting in his confrontation with Melisandre. Awesome scene."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Lyanna Mormont, putting bitches in their place."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"DANY IS FINALLY HEADING TO WESTEROS!!!

AND ARYA IS SO CLOSE TO WINTERFELL!!!

AND JON IS THE FRIGGIN KING IN THE NORTH!!!

AND R+L=J CONFIRMED!!!

AND CERSEI STRAIGHT UP MURDERED LIKE EVERYONE!!!! 

THIS SEASON FINALE WAS AMAZING!!! "
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Tommen's death is actually may actually be the saddest for me because everyone used him and viewed him as a means to play the game rather than a person, including myself.

I never really cared about Tommen as a character, he was just an awkward kid in an awkward position, but to see him just give up, almost emotionlessly, made me realize how terrible his life has been since he became king."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Kinda choked up a bit when Danerys was giving Tyrion the pin
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Fuck, I'm honestly disappointed to see Margaery dead. She was such an interesting and capable opponent for Cersei. Once they started hinting at the wildfyre, I thought for sure she was going to escape the sept before those fucking Sparrow cunts stopped her.

Edit: Lots of people replying with the fact that even if she had escaped the sept, the explosion was so big that she would have died anyways. True, but the explosion is only as big as the plot demands. My point was that I thought the show was leading up to her escaping, and leaving behind those in the sept to die."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,I loved that Margery dropped the facade in the end and was like screw your gods we need to get the fuck out of here
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Only Olenna Tyrell could make a scene in Dorne good.
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"""Some of you are alright.  Don't go to the sept tomorrow.""

HOT PIE FUCKING CONFIRMED"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,The Starks send their regards
6,10,The Winds of Winter,The chandeliers at the Citadel were straight out of some Dwemer ruins.
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"the soundtrack during the entire trial sequence was just.. beyond perfect, I was totally blown away by it."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Tommen's death scene was so beautifully done. No music. Just his footsteps walking up to the window. No hesitation showed with jumping. It was so beautiful in a sad way. He knew what he was going to do the instant he saw that smoke. All hope just thrown out the window (no pun intended). What a great way to end a character.
6,10,The Winds of Winter,I already miss Natalie Dormer. 
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Lyanna is lying in bed. ""Oh she's gonna say the thing"" *Promise me Ned* ""OH SHE SAID THE THING"""

6,10,The Winds of Winter,The music in the opening scene was fucking incredible
6,10,The Winds of Winter,I can't believe they outdid themselves again. I thought The Door would be the best episode of this season. Then I thought The Battle of the Bastards would be after last week. But here we are. This is probably my favorite episode of the series.

6,10,The Winds of Winter,"I know much of the discussion is going to center around the AMAZING episode and the HUGEEE implications that follow but man, I just had to point out how great the music was this episode. From start to finish, the music brought so much emotion, tension, and really built each and every scene up."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,R+L=J FUCKING CONFIRMED!!!!
6,10,The Winds of Winter,[deleted]
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"My initial thoughts after watching the finale:

- That scene between Dany and Tyrion was so dear and so precious - seeing him finally finding acceptance and being valued (in her making him the hand) was so emotionally fulfilling. 
- Seeing Arya complete her transformation from the child who was surrounded by loss and suffering to the badass who ended Walder Frey was so satisfying. 
- Even as a child Lyanna Mormont seems more driven and clear minded than the shows other female protagonists (Dany, Sanda, Cersei...etc). I'm excited to see her storyline. 
- The soundtrack was so on point this episode, especially building up the tension in the opening scene. 
- The ugliness in the simplicity of Tommen's suicide was heart wrenching. 
- Jamie finally realizing the magnitude of his sisters evil was satisfying.
- Even though he didn't say a word seeing Theon standing upright, as if he had a newfound sense of purpose was so so beautiful. 
- AFTER 6 SEASONS SHE'S FINALLY CROSSING THE SEA! 

It's been a great season with you all!
THANK YOU ALL!!! "
6,10,The Winds of Winter,How fucking amazing is it that the person who rises to defend Jon and the first person to declare him King in the North shares his mother's name?
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"THIS GIRL IS THE FUCKING TRUTH. GET HER A JUICE BOX.
"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"I never thought they could make me more hyped for S7 after the EP9. But holy shit was this 11/10, will watch again."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Unsullied + Dothraki + Martell + Tyrell + Grayjoy fleet + 3 Dragons + Master of Whispers + Tyrion = one OP army.  
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"What happened to Brienne? I was hoping to see her and Pod back in Winterfell by now. Note to self: when visiting Westeros, NEVER get in a row boat. "
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Lyanna Mormont is the disappointed mother of the North.
6,10,The Winds of Winter,We need a lip reader!  What is Jon Snow's real first name?  I'll bet it's Aejon. 
6,10,The Winds of Winter,It took Lady Mormont all of 3 scenes to become one of my favorite characters ever in GoT. Gottdamn I fuckin love that little badass

Tyrion finally getting recognition for his merit was tear-jerking.

6,10,The Winds of Winter,How the HELL did they manage to top the Battle of the Bastards immediately!?!?
6,10,The Winds of Winter,ARYA DID SOMETHING
6,10,The Winds of Winter,[deleted]
6,10,The Winds of Winter,If this episode doesn't get nominated for its soundtrack then I'll go eat wildfire. 
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"When the pussy is so good, you kill yourself to follow it"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"For those who haven't read the books:

Arya's human pie was in reference to [the story Bran told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV5txCNDco0) while they were hiding in the Nightfort at the wall. ""It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook, or for serving the King's son in a pie... he killed a guest beneath his roof... that's something the gods can't forgive.""

Frey broke the rites of hospitality, so his sons were served to him in a pie.

edit: yes. it was also a reference to the pie scene in the books if you want to look at it that way. They were both referencing the story of the rat cook but used different characters to serve the pie.


[this is a link to the clip from the show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV5txCNDco0). Links are hard to see on this sub apparently.

Super sweet! Thanks for the gold stranger!"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"I know these were two smaller scenes but first I want to give credit to Liam Cunningham as Davos. Him confronting Mel, seeing him get choked up while still so angry is a testament to his acting ability. I got a little choked up just watching him 

Also, I am so glad Tyrion is Hand of the Queen. His role as Hand was his best and I'm glad to see someone choose him for it. Peter Dinklage was also great at not only showing his fidelity for Dany but at showing his deep gratitude for her seeing him as a person and not just a dwarf"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"SIXTH SEASON BEST SEASON

6,10,The Winds of Winter,"I can confidently say that was one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. A masterwork. Almost every frame meant something. Watch the interaction on the wall between Sansa and Jon. We open on them next to each other, separate. And for the rest of the scene--and episode--we never see them make eye contact again. Very intentionally, we cut from his perspective to hers. Or, my favorite, when Tyrion is named Hand. Best moment I can remember. He drops to his knee, genuinely moved--something he has never done before--and when he does, the jug of wine he had with him was to his back. A lifelong crutch and vice, literally behind him as he encounters, for the very first time in his life, a Purpose, with a capital P. God, I could obnoxiously wax poetic for much longer."

6,10,The Winds of Winter,"I feel that the suicide of Tommen was especially intriguing due to the lack of music. When you watch him walk up to the window and jump, there isn't any music that adds to the scene. It's just silence, the sound of his footsteps and the burning in the distance. It really contrasts with the previous wildfire scene, where the ominous piano theme was signaling chaos. Also, notice how Tommen leaves his crown. He abandoned his royal identity and took the jump like any other individual would. No monologue or last words. The suicide is not romanticized or dramatic at all, but full of realism."

6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Can we take a second to applaud how absolutely phenomenal the music was today? It absolutely took the experience to an entirely new level for me tonight. Bravo.

EDIT: A word"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Lady Mormont fucking three time MVP now.

6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Alright, have to make sure I don't die so I can watch the next season. "
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Honestly, now we know which choices Cersei would make in Fallout 3. RIP Megaton"

6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Damn...Ned was the man... 

Lied to his own wife about cheating and having a bastard son but only he knew he wasn't truly a cheater but just trying to protect his sister. 

Rip Ned Stark - the true MVP. "

6,10,The Winds of Winter,"On a scale of one to Tommen Baratheon, how bad was your last breakup?"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Cercei looked very Romulan in this episode.
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Hands up if you just finished watching it and have decided that it's a good time to rewatch the entire series. :-)
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"It's the attention to even the smallest of details that I appreciate:

6,10,The Winds of Winter,"""My name is Arya Stark. You killed my mother. Prepare to die."""
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Most beautiful Arya Stark scene 
6,10,The Winds of Winter,THE MUSIC IN THIS EPISODE!!! Man it was on point tonight!!!
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Best season finale. Arguably the best episode of GOT.

The music at the start is so good. Cersei looks like a dark version of Joan of Arc. Margaery is gonna be missed. I was hoping she would live. And poor Tommen, i felt so bad for him. That scene was great, though.

Arya is back serving pies. I was shouting for her to kill Lord Frey and stab him hundred times.

Ser Davos just let all of his emotions out. It was so touching. 


It's nice to see Sansa apologized to Jon about Littlefinger and the KotV. And that she refused LF's proposal. And the fact that she was smiling showing her approval when Jon was hailed as Kingofthenorf! And oh Jon Snow, i was wondering how would Bran tell the world about Jon's parents. But to confirm this is already satisfying.

Lyanna Mormont, you're the real MVP. Winter is here and it's great to see the north united.

I sensed the fear of Tyrion going back to Westeros. When Dany put the HotK pin on him, i got this feeling that Tyrion will die.

I love the scene when Lady Olenna silenced the sand snakes. And damn, Varys got that teleportation skills, too.

I can't believe we need to wait for another year. Bring the winds of winter, GRRM."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Margaery was so hot that episode , I'm not suprised Tommen fell for her"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Tommen took King's Landing very literally 
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Haha, that Lady Olenna scene insulting the Sand Snakes was such fan service"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Totally loved the Rat King throwback with Arya... Jamie is definitely going to kill Cersei now; when Dany's army lands, Cersei would rather blow up the city than give it up (like the Blackwater) and he'll be the King & Queen Slayer."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Tommen would still be king if he had a better Kings Landing
"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"You guys... It just hit me. John has a direwolf, because he is a Stark. But his direwolf is silver-white..... BECAUSE HE'S ALSO A TARGARYEN OMG GRRM YOU SLY DOG HOLY SHIT. "
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Varys with Littlefinger's teleportation technique right there.
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"How many days does Jon have to wait to marry Lady Mormont? Never thought I'd be googling ""Age of consent laws in Westeros""... ended up deciding they should just be like good friends!"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"The death count this episode pretty insane

Cersei is the mad queen, Jamie won't be happy

Cleganebowl?...

Suddenly it's pretty ok to be a Stark (Go Arya & Jon!)

Thanks for the confirmation G&G...

KING IN THE NORTH

All the pieces are in place, let's get hype for S7"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Damn, Jon was a really ugly baby.

6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Dany: ""You want to be my Mistress?""
Yara: ""Too late, I called Dibs"""

- Winter is here!

See you all next year!

Edit: best season of every show I've ever watched!"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"This episode was just fucking phenomenal. Absolutely god damned fucking phenomenal. The first fifteen minutes, the Sept of Baelor, the wildfyre nuke going off, we all knew this was coming, we could see it coming from a mile away and yet thanks to masterful direction and amazing scoring, it was still the most tense and fucking amazing scene in the entire episode. 

Davos delivering such a hateful and distraught accusation and demanding a confession from Melissandre, that shit was so fucking emotional and horribly sad, I was so fucking sad for him because Shireen was more of a daughter to him than anything else and it was so heartfelt and horrible to see him in angry tears that I just felt him so much.

Jon Snow is named king of the North and he deserves it, but I can't help but think that it won't be a happy ending for him, last time a king in the North was proclaimed, he got stabbed by his own banner men. But at the same time, Jon is all about leading the North against the White Walkers, the real threat, the long night, so perhaps it may not be as doomed to fail as Robb's brief tenure as king.

Arya, Frey Pie, Throats cut. I don't need to say anymore but god damn I'm so fucking satisfied with Walder getting his comeuppance from Arya. Starks send their regards bitch. 

Daenerys is finally, finally heading home, finally, after six seasons, she's finally coming home, finally heading finally home, fin-fucking-ally. Let's hope she doesn't run into any problems along the way, like, I don't know, maybe a small Naval entanglement with the other thousand ships heading for them from the Iron Islands? Someone here once said there was a Naval Battle in Game of Thrones future and I think they're right, and it's not going to be as simple as sending the Dragons out I don't think. Also, Dorne returned, but we had Olenna and Varys so it wasn't so bad. Fire and motherfucking Blood bitches.

Cersei Lannister got crowned rule of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the first men, queen of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Tommen jumped out a fucking window which was both brilliant, shocking and unintentionally hilarious given that's how Jaime tried to kill Bran before. You can see the glance that Cersei shares with Jaime, there's something there, but it's not love, it's not sadness, there's a certain coldness between them now, but Cersei, knowing well that the Valonqar prophecy is close to its fulfillment, will still never believe that it would be Jaime to end it all. 

All in all, this episode far surpassed the Battle of the Bastards, it was perhaps the strongest in the series in my opinion from all aspects and it's sad...but...

It marks the beginning of the end of this amazing show, we still have a season and a half left worth of episodes to come, two seasons with seven episodes or something, perhaps they'll change their minds, I hope they do, but still, this is the beginning of the end of something that has spawned endless pages of fan theories and will likely continue to do so even when the series is done. It's the beginning of the end of something that brought this subreddit together and will keep this subreddit together long after the series is done. It's the beginning of the end of the Long Night, the great battle that has been built up since we first saw those icy fingers lift a decapitated head in the first moments of season one, which is aptly called a cold open. But even though we face the end of a series that has given us televised and perhaps one could even say cinematic history unfolding before our eyes, we can all think about how it's been a fucking hell of a ride.

Winter is here."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Cersei's Mixtape is on fire 🔥🔥🔥
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"I didn’t think that anything in this season could make me happier than seeing the Stark Direwolf back on Winterfell, but Arya found a way. She Tutus Andronicused that motherfucker"

6,10,The Winds of Winter,"""the last thing you're ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die"" and smile she did"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"There was so much to like about this episode, but for me personally seeing Arya finally slaughter Walder Frey was immensely satisfying.  It was every bit as pleasing as watching Ramsey get his last week.  I have been team Arya since day one and tonight was just effing magical."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Ned probably killed those women
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Can we just appreciate how fucking noble Ned Stark is? He took Lyanna's son, claimed him as his own to keep the boy safe, lied to everyone including his wife, and took the secret to his grave. "
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Nine years old and she is *shaming men old enough to be her GRANDFATHER.*  

Lady Mormont, how many husbands will you lay to rest?"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"How much less awesome scenes would be if we were shown the setups they had.

Cersei: ""OK, when I smirk and say ""You won't die today"", you walk in, stand for a second, remove the helmet menacingly and then start torturing her""

""OK, Varys, when I ring the bell, you casually walk in, wait for me to say ""Justice"" and then you go ""Fire and blood"". Boom, that will be so fucking awesome!""

6,10,The Winds of Winter,R+L=J is confirmed but that's not even the biggest fucking thing that happened. This episode was amazing. Cersei cleared out half the cast of King's Landing and declared herself queen. The Freys got fucked and Arya finally got shit done. Daenerys has assembled a motherufkcing fleet and is sailing Westeros with it. DAENERYS IS FINALLY COMING
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"The payoff on this episode was amazing:

* Cercei MadQueening it
* Arya switching faces on Walder Frey
* Lady Mormont leading a room full of stubborn northerners in remembrance
* R + L = J
* Daenarys setting sail"

Bronn: fuck it!

Jaime: they're not my type.
Bronn: not blonde enough?"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,This is how you do a season finale...looking at you TWD.
6,10,The Winds of Winter,**R+L = J IS GOING TO BREAK THE INTERNET TODAY. LETS FUCKING GO! KING OF THE NORTH!**	
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Damn, so many things happened this episode. So many RIPs in particular

- RIP High Sparrow + House Tyrell. I'll only miss Margaery, I think. EDIT: Thanks /u/tcain5188 

- ""You're not going to die today. You're not going to die for quite a while"". Badass line from full-psycho-mode Cersei

- Nope, no Joffrey head

- Wow, really anticlimactic death for Tommen

- Last episode about Red God: ""He's the one we've got."" This episode: ""He's evil.""

- So we've got Dorne + Tyrells + Dany now? With the girlpower Dany's gathering, Sansa is probably next to join the alliance

- ARYAAAAAAAAA. Oh, uh, Frey pies confirmed I guess

- Lyanna (Mormont) MVP

- ""Long may she reign."" Eh, that's not gonna happen"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"I'm so happy that R+L=J  is confirmed, and I screamed a lot, but not surprised at all.

BUT YESSSSS FUCK YESSSS"
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"HOLY FUCK. WHAT AN EPISODE.

That opening scene was so fucking beautiful. The music was perfect, the use of the kids to lure them out and ignite the wildfire. Fucking brilliant.

JON FUCKING TARGERYAN, BITCHES! God that was so satisfying. The King in the North and future king of the seven realms. 

And the whole Arya thing was so unexpected. Fucking brutal too. At first I thought it was from Jaime's command to kill Walder Frey. I just hope Arya doesn't kill Jaime somehow in the future."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Things went from 0 to 11 faster than I could've ever even processed. 

This show, man. Kill off half the cast in one scene. "
6,10,The Winds of Winter,[Jon and Davos to Melisandre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBXNBogxpvQ)
6,10,The Winds of Winter,Oh that poor girl has to go back to dragging Bran around! Benjen could have at least left her the horse!
6,10,The Winds of Winter,That dress on Cersei was ridiculously gorgeous and fit her character this episode to a T.
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"Wow. Whatever shortcomings I thought this season may have had, this episode and the one before really made up for it. I mean, shit. This episode tonight was just fantastic. Sept = Rekt. Jon Snow's origins, and him being chosen as king in the North. Tyrell/Dorne Alliance and who else are they allied to? Mofuckin Queen of Dragons et al with Tyrion as her hand. Oh and that fleet gave me the chills. Shit's about to get real.

Not to even mention Arya. Just straight badass killin some Freys. Also, how fitting that Cersei's last living child, Tommen falls from a tower to his death in response to her actions, when Bran being pushed from a tower as a result of her bidding began all the craziness of the entire series? Now Cersei sits upon the Iron Throne with no allies at all left, and a Targaryen queen rides towards Westeros, while unbeknownst to him, a Targaryen king is crowned king in the North. 

I may be missing a few cool parts, but man this is maybe the most satisfying episode I've ever seen. Fantastic."
6,10,The Winds of Winter,We need a lip-reader to watch that tower of joy scene
6,10,The Winds of Winter,This just reaffirmed how much of an amazing man Ed was. He took in his nephew as if he were his son and lived with the (self-imposed) shame of cheating on Catelyn. Sad that Cat hated Jon all those years for nothing though. 
6,10,The Winds of Winter,"I was kind of disappointed with how behind the times Olde Town was. I was hoping that'd be the scene that Sam finds out Jon was killed. 

Clerk - ""Bad news: Jon Snow was killed""

Sam - ""What?!""

Clerk - *moving finger further down the page* ""Good news: Jon Snow was brought back to life""

Sam - ""What. Well...I guess that's good.""

Clerk - *moving finger further down page* ""Bad news: Jon left the Night's Watch. You need the approval of Lord Commander Edd to become a Maester"".

Loving the use of leitmotif in this show. That theme is distinct from the usual targaryan theme and the dragons' theme. It is specific to her relationship with Drogo and hasn't played since her vision in season 2, but without using words, the music tells us she is remembering Drogo's promise of the seven kingdoms."

7,1,Dragonstone,"What if Arya just kills Ed Sheeran, takes his face and leaves Westeros to go on tour?"
7,1,Dragonstone,Littlefinger gonna need to call a red priest to heal that Sansa burn
7,1,Dragonstone,"Didn't think so much shit would go down in the first episode, especially from Sam."
7,1,Dragonstone,Repto-Jorah scared the fuck out of me.

7,1,Dragonstone,"""If there was such thing as divine justice you'd be dead and that little girl would be alive!""

Easily my favorite qoute from the episode. "
7,1,Dragonstone,"Sansa's attitude towards Jon in this episode tells me that she most likely will not act against him in resentment. She clearly understands that he is a very good-hearted man, and compliments his leadership. Also, she in a way alluded to feeling love for him when she said that she did not want Jon to make the same dumb mistakes her brother and father had, who she loves dearly. Her understanding of LF and his intentions (that shared look with Brienne tho) underlines my inclination to believe that she will not be manipulated by him so easily against Jon. That being said, if she believes Jon is acting naively, she may step in...behind his back. "
7,1,Dragonstone,"Arya: ""Hey I haven't heard that song.""

Ed Sheeran: ""It's a new one.""

7,1,Dragonstone,Daenerys should've blacklight checked that table before rubbing her hands all over it
7,1,Dragonstone,"I noticed that everyone was wearing black. Cersei, Sansa, Jon, Daenerys... hell, even Littlefinger. It really ties in with everything that's been developing up until this point.

Also, did anyone else feel like Cersei has finally, completely snapped? Calling her son's suicide an act of betrayal. The bloodlust and desperation to conquer everything, or scorch the world to ashes trying.

This season is going to be *so good*."
7,1,Dragonstone,"Oh hey, it's Walder Frey they must be doing some kind of flash ba... HOLY SHIT ARYA JUST MURDERED A WHOLE HOUSE!!!!!!!!"
7,1,Dragonstone,"Fucking Lyanna Mormont. I swear that girl is the best hype man. Like, what the fuck are you supposed to do when a little girl shows everyone how much of a pussy you are. Literally everything she says makes all the big badass northerners cheer.

7,1,Dragonstone,Lady Mormont should just charge the Night King head on. She'd whoop his ass.
7,1,Dragonstone,"Shall we begin?

That was a great episode to set up where everything will go this season. "
7,1,Dragonstone,"So Jon goes to Dragonstone to get Dragonglass where Dany will be.

Yes Cersei because you have just been a PARAGON of good, logical, decisions lately."
7,1,Dragonstone,"""Hey Jaime, that Targaryen girl is going to Dragonstone."" 

""Really? Well, guess we'll have to warn our men.""

""What?""

""You know, the guards we have placed on Dragonstone. Since it's pretty close to Kings Landing and would be fucking horrible if a lady with flying dragons got it, we should make sure our bannermen have enough warning to hold that strategic location."""

7,1,Dragonstone,Lyanna Mormont putting grown men in their place is so satisfying

7,1,Dragonstone,Prediction: Arya will kill Ed Sheeran and use his face to gain VIP entry to King's Landing 
7,1,Dragonstone,"The cold open was the absolute best of the show so far. 

I love how Daenerys bypassed the Dragonglass Throne for the ""ops room"". It shows she's learned something from her time in Essos. Let's hope hubris doesn't get the better of her. Also, notice the layout is the same as in the Red Keep? Door to the right of the thrones leads to the small council chambers.

Jon Snow's heritage is currently known (as far as we know from the show alone) to one living person-Bran Stark. Is that the sort of thing you trust to a raven? Will Jon find out the truth of his parentage before he meets with Queen Daenerys? More crucially, what will she accept as proof and will she react with hostility, since that's all she knows from her male relatives?

Sam-that was a hilarious and gross scene and it helped break up the tension. How old is little Sam? Four? How much time has passed since the Dragon Fleet launched? 

Not much actually happened though, but it's okay. This was setting the table and inviting us to feast. This is Game of Thrones and, if the Dragonstone visuals are anything to go by, we are in for a hell of a banquet. "
7,1,Dragonstone,Was that Lord Friendzone the one in the cell?

7,1,Dragonstone,"For a murdering beast of a man, Sandor Clegane is certainly a compassionate individual towards innocent people. 

When I saw that skeleton of the father and his child, I knew that Clegane was going to bury them. I love that about him. "

7,1,Dragonstone,My guess is Gendry built all those ships. With his arms that muscular after all that rowing it was probably really easy for him. 
7,1,Dragonstone,"So, [this dagger](http://i.imgur.com/ItJktc3.jpg) was on one of the pages of Sam's book that he was looking at when we found out about the dragonglass beneath Dragonstone.  Looks a little [familiar](https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3882/15158879291_a7b9bea8d5_b.jpg), don't you think?"
7,1,Dragonstone,"The scene with Dany was nice a callback to Daario's words about how she's a conqueror, not a ruler.  She walked right past the throne on Dragonstone to the map of Westeros to begin her attack, not content to sit for even a moment."
7,1,Dragonstone,Am I the only one disappointed that the sigil for kings landing in the opening credits is still a stag and not a lion now that Cersei is queen?
7,1,Dragonstone,Lady Mormont for president! 
7,1,Dragonstone,"House Stark now has:

Wise leader with unparalleled swordsmanship and combat experience 

A true pro when it comes to the politics of the game and a perfect bridal chip

He rode through the streets of the city,

Down from his hill on high.

O'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles,

He rode to a woman's sigh.

For she was his secret treasure,

She was his shame and bliss.

And a chain and a keep are nothing,

Compared to a woman's kiss.

For hands of gold, 

Are always cold,

But a woman's hands are warm. (x2)

""You should try it, feels wonderful.""
So subtle and cheeky but I literally burst out laughing. Favourite line of the episode for me."
7,1,Dragonstone,Who else was expecting to see undead hodor and was dissapointed/relieved when they didnt?
7,1,Dragonstone,"To the people who think Arya is heading south are wrong. That scene wasn't about showing soldiers as nice guys too instead of rapists and thieves, it was about family and going home. Each one talked about their family, the boy with the blackberry wine talked about he just wants to be home with his dad on the boat, the young dad just wants to see his first born, not knowing if it was a boy or girl. He said something that resonated with Arya, he wanted a girl because girls take care of their fathers in old age, while sons go off to fight in others wars. The scene put back the value of family and duty. She is the lone wolf, she needs to return to Winterfell, it's her duty. The list will have to be put aside."
7,1,Dragonstone,"WOW WHAT A START!

* Arya with the multi-kill was everything! I wanted the Frey's to die for so long and it was really satisfying to see her get some justic for the family.
* The Hound was without a doubt the MVP of this episode, pretty much every line he had was perfection. I loved how he buried the farmer and was even shook from the flame vision.

For those who don't know, in the books, a character only known as the Gravedigger is suspected to actually be the hound, and he is in a similar situation as the hound was in his first appearance in season 6. I just thought this was a nice under the radar connection between the books and show.

7,1,Dragonstone,Has EVERYONE forgotten that Little Finger is the most dangerous person in the 7 kingdoms? That he's always 5 steps ahead? That his end goal is to sit on the throne? Apparently Sansa doesn't fucking remember because she's acting like a catty bitch towards little finger even though he saved her and her brothers ass. I think making an enemy of Little Finger is going to be a HUGE mistake. WTF is she doing?

7,2,Stormborn,Euron is actually fucking insane. I have such a love/hate relationship for him. 
7,2,Stormborn,"Everyone in this thread is ripping on Theon.  You guys realize that NOT ONLY did Euron just single-handedly decimate Yara's fleet, but also slaughtered Theon's entire army, a crew of Ironborn who were probably twice the fighters Theon was even before he got tortured for a year and a half and had his dick cut off?

Theon had no chance of rescuing Yara.  None whatsoever.  Euron 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt would have killed him, and possibly Yara too.  The fact is, Theon did the only thing that gave him even the slightest chance of survival.  And him surviving & Yara being captured is far better than him dying & Yara being captured, which is *literally the only other way that could have gone down.*"
7,2,Stormborn,"What did the archmaester say he was writing to Sam? Something about everything that happens after King Robert? There's been speculation before that this is a story being retold and there's some connection to the citadel with the spinning rings in the library. Sam says something like the title needs to be more poetic. Perhaps ""A Game of Thrones"" or ""A Song of Ice and Fire""?"
7,2,Stormborn,Somebody told Euron about the plan to move Ellaria back to Dorne with Yara and Theon in tow...
7,2,Stormborn,"Man, it's going to be *really* awkward when Davos sees Melisandre at Dragonestone."
7,2,Stormborn,Am I the only one that wanted to see Grey Worm's....grey worm?
7,2,Stormborn,"**""That's not you""**

After D&Ds explanation, that probably became my favorite part of the episode.

If you couldn't catch the after episode special:

In Season 1, Ned talked to Arya about she was going to grow up to be a proper lady and Arya told him ""that's not me""

When Nymeria turns away from Arya, Arya realizes Nymeria can't have a domesticated lifestyle anymore than Arya can. They are both wild, free, and independent.  They have their own identities and purposes independent of eachother and that's okay.

7,2,Stormborn,Cersei pulling the trigger on that massive crossbow was a nice parallel back to Joffrey
7,2,Stormborn,I have never been more scared for Jon after he pinned Lord Baelish up against the wall just like Ned did in season 1.
7,2,Stormborn,"The whole episode seemed to give just the right amount of resistance to success, obstacles in the paths of the characters that aren't too easy or preposterously hard.  It showed how no one is safe in this world, giving a very human vulnerability to almost everyone.

Perfect that Arya met Hot Pie again and learned the one thing that could change her path's direction.  She chooses the pack, not to be the lone wolf.   Having her then see Nymeria again was just right, as was the particular way in which it happened.  It's been a long time and she drove her direwolf away when they last saw each other.  This kind of reunion makes sense.  But I hope they'll be together again.

The objections of the Northerners to Dany's invitation were reasonable.  Great payoff to even Lyanna Morment disagreeing - before, she always agreed with Jon.  Hopefully Sansa will do a good job in his absence.

Loved the conversation between Dany and Varys.  It was long overdue.  Even as Varys gave good reasons for why he stands for Dany now, and she appreciates that, there's a glimpse of Aerys in her threat to burn him alive.

Glad that Randyll Tarly didn't go over to the Lannisters' side too easily.  Likewise, his son Sam's efforts to cure Jorah weren't easy at all.  Jorah's humanity and vulnerability in his pain were beautifully acted.
  
The love scene between Missandei and Grey Worm had its own obstacles, but I'm glad that they overcame them.  It's sweet to see such a moment even in this world.  

The Sand Snakes actually redeemed themselves this episode.  Maybe their previous big fight really was ruined by the limited filming time.  Perhaps Mylod's redeemed himself too."

* Jon choking Littlefinger just like Ned did back in S1. Starks... quick tempers, slow minds.

7,2,Stormborn,I was looking forward to Arya riding Nymeria back to Winterfell.
7,2,Stormborn,"Two things: 

1.) Tyrion without a doubt proved himself as the most capable person to serve as Dany's hand. Nobody else in that room seems to give a fuck about Jon Snow, but Tyrion realizes immediately the significance of Jon - a teenage bastard from a family that had previously been all but ground to a powder - being promoted to Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, ending the *millennia fucking old* enmity between the wildlings and the Northerners, destroying House Bolton *and* being crowned King in the North. Immediately Tyrion knows that either Jon's the most capable leader on the continent or that the Northerners are so fed up with Southern Rule that they will back any claim - possibly even both. For Dany to explicitly decree that he will be subjugated and for Tyrion's letter to say nothing of the sort shows that he's far more politically savvy and has a deeper understanding of Westerosi culture. I don't think Dany full understands the significance of a bastard accomplishing all of this, but Tyrion does.

2.) Euron Greyjoy would never have been able to beat the Sand Snakes. Period. I didn't like the characters, but they were clearly better fighters than he. Also, shouldn't he be lying dead somewhere in a pool of his own piss from the poison they coat their weapons with?"

7,2,Stormborn,That episode felt like a typical GoT episode on cocaine. Super fast paced.
7,2,Stormborn,"This was one of the first episodes where I was really impressed by Masie's acting. Not that she has been bad, but this episode had me really impressed. Her reactions to seeing Nymeria and hearing that Jon was now King in the north were fantastic "
7,2,Stormborn,"- They were saying what Euron would do this season would make Joffrey and Ramsay look like children. I now believe them. ""Give your uncle a kiss"". Holy fuck he was an absolute beserker, like a legendary viking. 

- Nymeria scene was heartbreaking. Especially with the somber Stark Theme playing.

- The counseling between Dany and her advisors were incredibly well done. Some old school Game of Thrones right there

- RIP Sand Snakes. See you next month Colleen in the Defenders. 

- Scene transitions were absolutely incredible. From removing the Grey Scale to Arya eating in the tavern; and the beginning of the naval ambush actually made me audibly gasp

7,2,Stormborn,Cersei and Qyburn just casually irreparably damaging the perfectly intact skull of arguably the greatest dragon to ever live. That made me so mad. 
7,2,Stormborn,"Shoutout to Euron Greyjoy for being the first Greyjoy in history to do something worthwhile. 


Also, as attractive as Missendei is, did anyone else think that the sex scene went on for a little too long? Like, I get it, we gotta fill the T&A quota, but we have a very limited number of minutes left of this series, and I don't want to spend them with a scene like this that probably just means Grey Worm bites it at Casterly Rock. "
7,2,Stormborn,NYMERIA YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARD
7,2,Stormborn,"""You are my weakness."" 

Grey Worm professing his love to Missandei may been the most tenderly sweet moment of the entire series. "
7,2,Stormborn,[deleted]
7,2,Stormborn,"Lol at Sam shushing Jorah. That scene was painfully funny, and that cutscene..."
7,2,Stormborn,Hot Pie wanted Arya's hot pie
7,2,Stormborn,"Theon made the right choice...I'd jump ship too before kissing my uncle. 

And Sam is growing up fast. Where once he whimpered at the night's watch training, he is now hungrily slicing of hunks of Jorah's greyscale like it's bacon. "
7,2,Stormborn,"""A foreign invasion is underway."""
7,2,Stormborn,Euron was lethal. He really messed up Theon once again. Great episode.
7,2,Stormborn,"The emergence of the Silence out of the storm was one of the best things I've ever seen.

Maniacal Eurion and his axe was one of the best things I've ever seen.

That was one of the best things I've ever seen. More please."
7,2,Stormborn,What's the deal Sam? No Milk of the Poopy? 
7,2,Stormborn,Theon's face transition to Reek was unbelievably well done by Alfie Allen.
7,2,Stormborn,"""Rickon, is it?""
""No. Dickon""

Hahahahahahahahaha. Dick-on"
7,2,Stormborn,Almost had two sex scenes both of which dickless.
7,2,Stormborn,Littlefinger is gonna try to doublecross Jon and will prob get killed for it
7,2,Stormborn,"Theon sure did leave his sister hanging.

But seriously though, I'm glad they cut down on the Sand Snakes this season. Euron really should have given them some tips on fighting. Every time they were on screen it felt like they were slowly choking the life out of the show. You could tell the writers had wanted to axe their storyline for a while now. 

All they've done so far is poison a teenage girl and a murder a cripple and they were talking about taking on *the Mountain* like they were the hottest bitches in Sunspear. Oberyn's shaking his pomegranate head.

Euron left them bowed, bent, and broken.

^^^The ^^^two ^^^dead ^^^girls ^^^were ^^^the ^^^sand ^^^sneks."
7,2,Stormborn,I KNOW GREY WORM CAN'T SMASH MISSANDEI BUT HE CAN STILL EAT IT 👅👅
7,2,Stormborn,Hot Pie is so dead next episode. 
7,2,Stormborn,Arya goin North y'all!
7,2,Stormborn,All of the storylines finally coming together makes me so giddy. My heart won't be able to take Jon Snow and the Mother of Dragons in the same room

Did Ramsay Bolton miss his calling?"

7,2,Stormborn,Hey crows nest guy. Ring a bell whydontcha
7,2,Stormborn,I'm kind of annoyed that they are pretty much signaling that they'll kill a dragon. I want complete domination! 
7,2,Stormborn,"Can we talk about how Arya is going to barely miss Jon just how she barely missed Robb? So tragic...

7,2,Stormborn,"I know the character's name is Euron, but that was totally Victarion."

7,2,Stormborn,Grey Worm: this is where I'd put my penis... IF I HAD ONE! 
7,2,Stormborn,"Sam can find a super obscure CURE for greyscale + the various medical accoutrements, but he can't find any painkillers in the ENTIRE citadel. He's like ""nah the booze is fine you don't need milk of the poppy. Oh and here's some old leather to bite down on while I flay you. Also plz be quieter, thx."""
7,2,Stormborn,"cute note: When they transition from Dragonstone to Winterfell, we see a group of children being taught archery and that group includes girls."
7,2,Stormborn,Nymeria found her own squad.
7,2,Stormborn,Hot Pie is back on the menu!
7,2,Stormborn,Anybody else shed a tear when Arya turned North? :)
7,2,Stormborn,That hand in the books that closes the sex scene.
7,2,Stormborn,"People keep shaming Theon for being a coward. And he is, but I'd rather be a living coward than a dead brave man. Theon knows he doesn't stand a chance against Euron. And even if he did beat Euron, Euron's men will still slaughter him. That, and possibly Theon's PTSD triggered."
7,2,Stormborn,"A eunuch gets a lecture, another eunuch gets some action, and the last eunuch proves that he has no balls. "
7,2,Stormborn,Jheez Missandei is fit
7,2,Stormborn,At least Euron stopped a potential Dorne scene before things got out of hand
7,2,Stormborn,"Btw Sam waited like 30 seconds for the rum to kick in.

Bitch you gotta wait!! Jorah just ate dinner yo "
7,2,Stormborn,I see Danaerys is going for that lvl 13 elf mage look.

7,2,Stormborn,Ramsay really messed Theon up. It was really heart breaking to see him turn into Reek there at the end.
7,2,Stormborn,What are you standing over there for? A foreign invasion is on its way. Great little bit of foreshadowing there!
7,2,Stormborn,"Thought it was interesting foreshadowing that Yara and Ellaria have a conversation about Theon's role as being Yara's protector before the attack; Ellaria says he's ""so far away"" from Yara, and then Theon turns his back to leave."
7,2,Stormborn,"That shot of Euron boarding the ship, riding the ramp like a psycho.

I loved it."
7,2,Stormborn,"Watching Sor Jorah getting skinned, sure makes me grateful for anesthesia"
7,2,Stormborn,"That transition from gooey greyscale to yellow pie was brilliant... and morbidly disgusting.

7,2,Stormborn,Did the sand snakes forget to put poison on their spear or is Euron gonna die? 
7,2,Stormborn,"Theon Status:

☑ Reekt

☐ Not Reekt"
7,2,Stormborn,Shoutout to Davos for practicing his reading
7,2,Stormborn,"The sand snakes are dead?

#LONG LIVE EURON! WHAT IS DEAD MAY NEVER DIE!

But fucking Theon... will you ever truly be redeemed?

Also, was that not Nymeria? Or was it just Arya just trying to make herself feel better/a commentary of how she has changed so much that Nymeria doesn't recognize her anymore? (*Edit explained on the inside the episode, I'm happy with the direction they went, it makes sense)"
7,2,Stormborn,The new Pirates of the Caribbean is really brutal. 
7,2,Stormborn,THAT WAS ACTUALLY SAD.  The whole fight scene had me on the edge of my seat and my heart sunk when the sand snakes died even though i never really liked them
7,2,Stormborn,"Euron you had to go mess shit up man! Not gonna lie, that ship drop was badass! "
7,2,Stormborn,Euron with that axe. Holy fucking shit
7,2,Stormborn,Man if Ramsey had opened up a greyscale healing business he'd be a rich man
7,2,Stormborn,Tits are back on the menu boys.
7,2,Stormborn,"*Qyburn, why in the hell did you destroy that priceless artifact????*

~ everyone in the citadel."
7,2,Stormborn,"Holy shit, Theon is going to be The Prince that was promised. He is going to be reborn amidst the flaming wreckage of the fleet and the salt of the ocean, amongst the bodies of the Dornish princesses held high by the prows of the burning ships. Dorn is symbolized by a red sun with a spear through it, so a bleeding star. 

WTF, I never would have seen that coming. "
7,2,Stormborn,"Qyburn is really out here earning his keep. He is like Cersei's personal Santa Clause. You want dragon fire? Here you go. You need a way to kill dragons? Just make sure you leave some cookies, milk, and cadavers out on the council table ."

Nymeria: ""Do not call me that! Nymeria was my slave name. You shall now call me Smokey, because my fur is pretty and gray."""
7,2,Stormborn,did we just witness a GUY and a GIRL scissor?
7,2,Stormborn,"It's been bugging me. Cersei has changed all symbols and sigils to now show lanister. The star in the throne room, the banners in the city, hell she is Cersei Lanister, 1st of her name... So, why is there still a Boratheon logo in the opening cinematic animation of the map?"
7,2,Stormborn,DEAD POOSEY
7,2,Stormborn,Nathalie Emmanuel (Missandei) is by far the most beautiful woman I have ever seen on screen. Just...wow
7,2,Stormborn,[deleted]
7,2,Stormborn,"Jorah is gonna need more Rum than that, Jesus Christ."
7,2,Stormborn,"Came here only to defend Theons actions, because I knew people would shit on him for leaving, but Theon isn't stupid he knew that there was NO WAY to win that battle, all was lost. Euron was just goading him to try and get him as well as his sister but he made a tactical decision (with fear mixed in of course) to tell Daenerys about the loss of the ships and the Dornish army. Because without that knowledge they would proceed thinking that they STILL HAD the ships and the dornish, then they would be royally fucked. Theon has proved to not be a coward anymore, he stood and fought but when faced with complete loss or retreat he chose retreat. (but if I am wrong next episode feel free to pm me I told you so, but I think I am right.)"
7,2,Stormborn,"If Arya kills Little Finger, she could use his face to control his army. Just a thought. Tonight's episode was great. "
7,2,Stormborn,Got Reek Rolled tonight
7,2,Stormborn,"So when Dany asked Melisandrea why she thinks the lord of light chose Jon, why DIDNTshe mention the whole coming back from the dead thing? WHY DOESNT ANYONE TALK ABOUT THAT"
7,2,Stormborn,Poor theon. Either die like jack or live like rose. 
7,2,Stormborn,"Such a wildly awkward and unnecessary scene, but Grey Worm has some pretty good instincts for a guy who has never touched a girl."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,The final scene of GOT ends with the iron bank's accountant sitting in the throne room reading off a list of debts to a skeleton 
7,3,The Queen's Justice,Why do the red priests all seem to know some crazy shit about varys?

7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Thanks to Olenna's admission, Jaime and Cersei will now know for sure that Tyrion was innocent and he's fighting against them because of him being wrongly accused.

Edit: just want to make clear that I don't think it will actually make a difference to Cersei.

Edit2: I am 100% aware that Tyrion still killed Tywin. But one might look at it a bit differently when you realize Tywin sentenced Tyrion to die for something he didn't do.  Now *Cersei* wouldn't look at it differently, but Jaime and Tyrion were always close and it might change how Jaime views it."
7,3,The Queen's Justice, Why did Littlefinger look so startled to learn that there were copies of every raven message?

7,3,The Queen's Justice,Olenna with the best mic drop of the series.
7,3,The Queen's Justice,Isn't it obvious why Bran mentioned Sansa's rape? He's trying to ensure Sansa doesn't forget about what Littlefinger did to her. This occurred right after Littlefinger himself mentioned to be prepared for anything. I think Littlefinger is going to do something crazy next episode.
7,3,The Queen's Justice,I'm just happy they didn't end the episode with John meeting Daenerys with no meaningful dialogue
7,3,The Queen's Justice,Is it weird that my favorite thing was Sansa talking about food supplies? Its the happiest I've been since they showed that functioning farm in that one episode last season!

while the Stark reunion is like a puzzle bringing them back together one by one.    "

And that is why you don't split up your troops"
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Main takeaways from this episode:

1) Jon Snow has the biggest balls in all of Westeros.

2) Cersei still stays a savage.

3) Olenna always wins. Even if she loses. The real OG.

4) The Lannisters have had some great battle tactics as of late."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Anybody else think that Sam's ""punishment"" is actually a reward? I'm guessing those are scrolls relevant to the white walkers and the plight of the North from the restricted section of the Citadel library.

7,3,The Queen's Justice,"The person yelling ""you're the worst"" when the Sands were shown walking through the city has to be directly talking for the audience. I like it."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"It's odd, but i was pretty happy when Daenerys aknowledged that she was raped. Like with all honesty and owning it. It felt like it was the first time she did that, and i could be wrong. It kinda made me proud of her and the show."

Chill = 0"
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"All of this makes me realize. Daenerys needs a war general. Lost three of her allies over the span of two episodes because of poor planning. She has so much force but she's losing almost every battle. Even the temporary victory at Casterly Rock will be fleeting. 


Good thing Jorah is returning. "

RIP, Olenna. Queen of Thorns until the end."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"I very much liked Jon and Dany's first day together.

They both have excellent points to not blindly trust the other, and they laid them out well with a side helping of understandable hostility. Tyrion is definitely a better politician than general, because he managed to bridge at least some of the gap pretty competently.

Let's face it, Jon was asking for the impossible. Daenerys was never going to lend him her armies and her children so that he'd use them against a mythological evil he's given no proof of. However, when he did ask for something reasonable, Daenerys answered reasonably. Her turning to look at him after he left with that unmistakeable gaze also definitely hinted at something more between them.

I think they're setting up the foundations for a nice collaboration."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Sansa is now a political mover and shaker

Bran is now a creepy af emotionless hippy talking to his sister about the night she was raped

Arya is now a creepy af emotionally stunted face changing murder machine

And the bastard son who used to be below them all is now their King

......gonna be a real awkward family reunion when they're all back in one room together"
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"I just want to say thank you to the writers! Playing on the fans jokes of Danys rediculous long title and Jon's lack of fucks to give. 

And the brooding joke. They pay attention and I'm really happy there was a good about of humor in this episode."

7,3,The Queen's Justice,Idk what it is but Emilia Clarke is looking extra fine this season. 
7,3,The Queen's Justice,I loved how Daenerys caught Tyrion using his own quote. 
7,3,The Queen's Justice,I think it might be time to use the dragons...
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"So who would've thought the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" was just a giant pissing contest"
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Drogon's showing off as usual. Couldn't pass up the chance to welcome the Northerners to Dragonstone! It's incredibly ironic to see Jon and Dany throwing barbs about their families considering those families are in fact one and the same. I can't help but feel the writers are taunting us by having Dany talk about Rhaegar in front of Jon. He seriously needs to learn his true heritage sooner than later! It's still incredibly surreal having all the ""good guys"" in one room. Having Jon and Tyrion once again standing on an edge and chatting was just so great.

And the reunions just keep on coming! I really hope Arya picks up the pace, if her past luck is any indication she'll get there just as EVERYONE ELSE LEAVES.

It's funny yet also frustrating that with all these storylines coming together all the characters have to do some major explaining of things that they just can't explain. Talking about the white walkers really does make you sound like a raving lunatic. Bran also needs to start recovering some of his people skills.

I'm glad to see the writers remembered Widow's Wail and gave it to Jaime. It's been far too long since we've seen it and Valyrian steel swords can't just be unaccounted for. If only the writers would pay attention to geography as well... Just keep a map in front of you, c'mon!

Speaking of how Oberyn should've let Gregor lay there and die, if his daughters had the same foresight Euron would be dying a slow death on the floor as well. He took hits from their weapons. The Snakes seriously can't do anything right."

7,3,The Queen's Justice,Jon taking none of Dany's shit is one of the most satisfying things I've ever seen. I've been waiting for that for a loooong time 
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"I never thought Jon & Dany would have this effective chemistry. It's insane, you'd think otherwise but now that it's here, the ship has sailed."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Lady Olenna is a savage 'til the very end. 

“Oh you wanna poison me? Fine, but I poisoned ya bastard son - and make sure his Aunty Momma knows it too, bitch!” 

*drops mic*

*drops dead*

“Worth it”"
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"You know one detail I like? You see these long overdue reunions/meet-ups of characters who have hardly or never shared on-screen appearances and when they do, the actors show a shitton amount of chemistry due to the actor's off-screen camaraderie that you can hear or see from social media or interviews. I know actors naturally have to act well with others but you can feel the GOT casts' close knitted-ness by just how they interact naturally off-screen and how that carries over to their performances on-screen. One such example was when Sansa and Jon finally met in the Wall where the actors played of the sibling chemistry so well. You can see it with Jon and his interactions with Tyrion and Dany as well as with Sansa & Bran reunion in this episode. Cause of that, I look forward to the upcoming character interactions as we are at a free fall to the finale of the series.

edited: forgot to point out Bran and Sansa as well!"
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"""Give me ten good men, I'll impregnate the bitch""

7,3,The Queen's Justice,I KNEW in the back of my mind something was wrong when I saw Cersei wearing lipstick. I just didn't put two and two together until it happened.
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"truthfully my biggest OMG moment was when cersei and jaime were naked in bed together and she was like, *nah it's alright, I'm gonna answer the door. they know i'm a brotherfucker, it's so chill bae.*"
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Cersei talking to Ellaria about murdering Myrcella was actually heartbreaking.

You can actually hear Cersei's voice crack and it made me feel empathetic towards her. Lena Headey did a fantastic job."

7,3,The Queen's Justice,No way Cersei would offer Olenna a quick and painless death. I think Jaime was lying and he brought the poison without Cersei knowing about it.

7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Goddamn, Queen of Thorns to the end."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Man, even with everything that's happened... this episode marked the point where every kingdom has been officially changed. A bastard as king in the North, Lannisters on the throne while Casterly rock bleeds and the last Tyrell downing a cup of poison. So much change since Robert rode North"
7,3,The Queen's Justice,Bran looked so zen.
7,3,The Queen's Justice,I feel so bad for Meera having to put up with Bran's shit for so long. She must be so happy now
7,3,The Queen's Justice,Watching that Lannister army March to Olenna's front door made me realize there needs to be a Game of Thrones Total War game.  Enough Warhammer.  Gimme Westeros.
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Grey Worm's chance of dying next episode: 110%
 "
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"This episode felt like a series of battles: struggles, manouevres, victories, and losses.  The Lannisters' ascent is almost dizzying.  I hope their fall is even more dramatic.

In spite of how much I despised Ellaria and the Sand Snakes for what they did to Doran, Trystane, and Myrcella, I couldn't feel anything but pity for her and Tyene.  It was painful to see them unable to even touch each other in the last shot.  They are separated by a tiny gap that is still all too wide, analogous for the death that will separate them before too long.  
  
The sole completely wrong note for me was the meeting with the Iron Bank, which shouldn't be vulnerable to a pro-slavery argument.  Isn't the *free city* founded by revolutionary slaves?

The long-awaited meeting between Jon and Dany was somewhat more antagonistic than it needed to be - perhaps a little contrivedly so - but far better to err in that direction than to make it too cordial.  They both had good reasons for their views and feelings towards each other.  They are two people with strongly held beliefs that shouldn't yield easily.  I'm glad that Tyrion managed to bridge some of the gap between them and that the North with get its dragonglass.

In just a few, very economical moments, Sansa was shown as a good, practically-minded ruler.  I liked the previous shout-out to her intelligence with Jon and Tyrion.  Her reunion with Bran seemed one-sided in its sweetness - she was clearly moved, but Bran seems like he's in an emotionless gaze.  Maybe that's just the way of things for him now. 
  
I'm sorry to see Highgarden fall and Olenna take poison, but she and her house already lost what mattered most.  Her final moments are eerily like Cersei's revenge, except, as always, with more class than Cersei ever had."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Did anyone else get so excited to see Sansa running to the gate and have Arya there? Aw man, it's just Bran. "
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"I'm wondering if Jaime will tell Cersei. On one hand he'll have to admit the murderer of their son had a quiet and painless death, on the gold hand it means he clears Tyrion's name but it doesn't matter now because he's sided with Dany anyway. 

I don't think he'll tell her, and according to him he's the only person alive who knows the truth since Olenna didn't rat out Littlefinger. "
7,3,The Queen's Justice,Gotta be one of the quickest paced episodes so far. 
7,3,The Queen's Justice,Kinda pissed at Varys. Couldn't he have at any point mentioned to Dany that Jon's father defended her and refuses to take part in having her killed? 
7,3,The Queen's Justice,Starting to wish we had 9 seasons instead of 8.  This pacing is ridiculously fast. Almost feels more like a movie. Dorne and Highgarden out of the fight already.
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"I can't wait till Arya gets home.

Arya: I'm a rogue assassin, trained by the most dangerous death cult.

Bran: I'm an omniscient tree-god, destined to save us all.

Jon: So I'm the true king of Westeros AND the King in the North?

Sansa: Engaged three times. Twice divorced. Probably gonna fall for Littlefinger before all is done."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"I like Sam's explanation: ""I read the book and followed the instructions."" He'll be the only one with some sense at Westeros U. "
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"What was up with that weird Varys/Melisandre bullshit...? Varys straight up had a ""thats so raven"" moment

7,3,The Queen's Justice,"""This is Jon Snow.""

Quote of the episode."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,WOW what a masterful episode. Mylod redeemed himself.  
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"* I love the continuity about the Rock. It's obvious that until Tywin told Cersei, the number of people that knew that the Rock's mines and the source of their power was actually gone. Obviously Tyrion never knew that the Rock was basically worthless.
* Olenna seem, besides showing a final bit of Olenna awesomeness is nicely setting up Jamie to finally understand what Cersei really is an kill her
* Bran's humanity is basically lost. He can't even figure out that he shouldn't super casual discuss his sister's rape and torture with her in that way.
* Dany flat out acknowledged that Drogo raped her. First time in a long time that she doesn't just view refer to him with pride or affection.

7,3,The Queen's Justice,The Lannisters are the New England Patriots of Westeros: the second you count them out they go win a road game on national television with a bunch of injuries against the trendy super bowl pick in the NFC and remind you why they've been running shit for as long as they have 
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"I've been super forgiving of the time hop/people teleporting stuff so far. I generally assume that we see key events, and events in an ep may be over a few weeks or something not necessarily at the same exact time...

But I'm sorry. You can't have this series of events make sense:

1. Danny sends Greyjoys/Dornish towards Dorne while simultaneously sending Grey Worm and co. to Casterly Rock

2. Euron intercepts and defeats the Greyjoy/Dorne  crew (fine with this, they were on opposite sides of Blackwater Bay)

3. Euron takes his time parading the captives around Kings Landing and flirting with the Queen

4. Euron magically ends up with a fleet of ships on the other side of the continent at Casterly Rock to burn Grey Worm's fleet

Wtf?

Is Euron some magical teleporting ace that we are going to use to win every battle anywhere on the planet?

I won't even get into how he built a huge fleet of ships capable of dominating the existing Ironborn fleet in what? A month or two?

I am getting worried that we are starting to rush too much and getting sloppy..."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,Olenna's last scene was incredible.
7,3,The Queen's Justice,Anyone else think Cersei is doing the same thing with Ellaria that Oberyn did with the Mountain? She should kill her while she has the chance.
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"I feel bad for Sansa. Her sister went off to join a death cult and became a psychopathic killer and now you have Bran... 30 seconds in and he's bringing up her rape, he could have proved he had the powers by telling her what she ate for breakfast. Creepy ass stark children."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Olenna downing that poisoned red like it's last call at 2am and she doesn't give a fuck about stumbling through her front door and waking her parents.

No, it fucking isn't. There was one, he transferred his powers and died, and now you're him, Bran. Not that hard. I can see how the writers wouldn't want him to recap it, but bloody hell."
7,3,The Queen's Justice,So isn't the whole city of Braavos founded around the idea of rejecting slavery? Why is the iron bank suffering at the loss in slave trade?
7,3,The Queen's Justice,"Cersei body double again?

I don't know why I expected Jon & Dany's first meeting to go better than it did, but at least he got the dragonglass

I hated the Sand Snakes as much as anyone but damn that was cruel

7,4,The Spoils of War,"Some of the many call backs in this episode:

1. Dany saying the exact same thing Jon once said to Mance Rayder:
 * Dany to Jon: ""Isn't their survival more important than your pride?""
 * [Jon to Mance](https://youtu.be/4i-FWK-dMp0?t=1m33s): ""Isn't their survival more important than your pride?""

2. Arya getting stopped by guards again when trying to get back into her home, [same as in season 1 episode 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekGeFt_Za0s).

3. [Davos quoting Stannis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wj38qTtFU):
 * Jon: 10,000 men, less?
 * Davos: Fewer
 * Jon: What?
 * Davos: Nothing

4. Bran quoting Littlefinger ""[Chaos is a ladder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxlIraEV8n4)""

5. Sansa said in season 6 episode 9 ""[No one can protect me.](https://youtu.be/CyLO5PSn-rM?t=2m36s)"" She's now being protected by No One.
 * Arya said to Sansa in this episode ""You need better guards.""

6. Robert Baratheon: ""[Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field.](https://youtu.be/QV6cefIbwMg?t=1m26s)"" (I know this wasn't Jaime's choice, but the results were the same)

7. Bronn asks Jaime early in this episode: ""All those new riches weighing you down?"" - Jaime is now sinking in the water, weighed down by his rich armor and hand.

-
I also think it's awesome that they pretty much combined Hardhome and Battle of the Bastards to get the battle in this episode. It has the suspenseful build up of Hardhome, then the tactics and formations of BotB, along with another one shot of someone (Bronn) stumbling through the chaos.

7,4,The Spoils of War,That look between Arya and Littlefinger. Arya was Tywin's cupbearer at Harrenhal and she saw first hand of Littlefinger and Tywin scheming together. He might have realized that Tywin's cupbearer was actually Arya (if he didn't know already). Littlefinger also realized where Arya has been. House Baelish was founded by a man from Braavos. Littlefinger has a connection to Braavos and most likely knows a lot about it. He saw Arya water dancing against Brienne and water dancing is the unique style of sword fighting mostly associated with the city of Braavos. He probably realized just how dangerous Arya can be now and where she was this whole time.

7,4,The Spoils of War,"10/10. Easy. 

So crazy the seasons of build up to this very moment. None of these people believed dragons existed. They've been dead forever.

Then they hear the army approaching from behind and start to get in file which is exactly what Dany wanted. 

Just seeing the army get turned to dust is horrifying from the perspective of a soldier. How do you fight that? 

Second - war is so fucked. I didn't know who I wanted to win here. Jamie fucking charging a dragon (YES I FUCKING KNOW HE'S TARGETING DANY) with a spear, while dumb, was awesome. Everyone knew it. Tyrion knew he was going to do it. It's just Jamie's character. 

Third was the Arya fucking flexing on Brienne. What a badass. Kudos to the teams and to Maisie for the work put in. The sword work while I'm sure not 'true to form' or whatever really made me think back to Syrio fighting those guards with a broken wooden sword.

Finally, with all the hype on everything else, I totally overlooked the Theon and Jon reunion. Tension for sure.

7,4,The Spoils of War,the HBO people clearly have a much harder time killing off main characters then GRRM.
7,4,The Spoils of War,"A+ episode.  Both the quiet moments and the incredible setpieces were full of emotion.

Enjoyed the opening banter between Jaime and Bronn.  While Bronn's demands reminded us of his mercenary nature, the mention of the High Septon also reinforced Jaime's allegiance to Cersei regardless of her awful deeds.

Based on the Tyrell gold being sent ahead of the grain, it looks like it will reach King's Landing, giving the Iron Bank their repayment.  I am still holding out hope that the Iron Bank are secretly working against Cersei, because I didn't buy the slavery line from the previous episode one bit (what with Braavos being a free city).  Ultimately, though, I expect the slavery stuff to be an oversight and that Tycho will help Cersei once he's paid.  In the brief scene between them this episode, I didn't see even the slightest foreshadowing that he might turn on her, so for him to end up doing that would be something of an asspull.

I really didn't like how inhuman Bran was with Sansa on his return - appreciated that it made sense, but didn't like it.  However, it really paid off in this episode, both in his creepy ""chaos is a ladder"" moment with Littlefinger and his heartbreaking insensitivity with Meera.  Meera's raw emotions contrasted with his blankness painfully.

Arya's return was very emotional.  Every moment seemed to evoke the past.  The scene with the two guards was a very obvious callback to a scene from season one, but even just having Arya sit for a while and look around Winterfell reminded us how long it had been since she was last there.  It felt good that Sansa knew where to look for Arya at once.  I was glad that their old divisions weren't played up too much and was glad 

The training bout between Brienne and Arya was a lot of fun, even though it annoyed me somewhat that Arya was so much better than Brienne.  I'm not entirely sure why Sansa left at the end, but I have a theory that she's trying to make Littlefinger think there's some gap between her and Arya that he can exploit (thus laying a trap for him).  My basis for this is Sansa's little smile during the Weirwood scene when Bran made her realise Arya's list wasn't a joke.  There was time for her to plan between that scene and this one.

The art in the dragonglass gaves was awfully convenient... both that it existed at all and that the images of the White Walkers were such high quality!  I like how a sense of respect (and eventual closeness) seems to be building between Jon and Dany slowly and naturally.  Their initial animosity is a great foundation for their present interaction.  It works so well that, by the time Dany turns to Jon for advice, it makes sense.  I also like the callback to Jon telling Mance to bend the knee and Mance explaining why the wildlings can't.  Jon must understand that so much better now.

Before Field of Fire 2.0, I liked the few moments taken with the Tarlys, reminding us how unpleasant Randyll is and showing us that Dickon is kinder.  Him being the favoured son over Sam wasn't his fault.

What an incredible battle.  Dany and the Dothraki were like a force of nature.  I pitied the Lannister soldiers.  Seeing one of them tremble as Bronn told Jaime to run was a really effective moment.  And then the shots of them burning alive... or of terrified horses putting a burning cart...  Very intense.  Dickon Tarly got a brief moment of heroism - and, of course, Bronn and Jaime pulled some extraordinary feats.

As Bronn cranked the scorpion, I had no idea what would happen - or what I wanted to happen.  The same when Jaime charged Drogon and Dany.  I liked all these characters and didn't want any of them to die, but their paths had put them in full opposition, and that was that.  Tyrion was like an audience surrogate here, imploring Jaime not to be a heroic fool.  Speaking of Tyrion, it was a very effective moment showing him watching his family's soldiers be slaughtered, particularly after Dany had upbraided him for not wanting his family to be hurt.  I felt in that moment that she was right... and yet, somehow, Tyrion's feelings weren't wrong.
  
I am left wondering what will become of the battle's survivors next episode.  Will Tyrion free Jaime, as Jaime once freed him?  That would feel like a betrayal of Dany that he could never recover from and I can't imagine it happening."

I was a little Stark reuniting with my brethren, living every second with anticipation and awe.

The Targaryan in me watched the dynamic duo grow closer together, the slow crescendo to the end of an amazing story I've followed for years - first in books, and now on the screen.

And now my palms are sweaty, my heart racing, as I take a breath after holding it for the twenty most gruesome, mesmerizing, exhilarating minutes I've experienced watching a show on TV.

I was rooting for both sides, for every person, a dragon, a cutthroat, a Queen, a Kingslayer, a dwarf... 

I'm spent.  I knew this was coming, but I was not prepared for any of it."

7,4,The Spoils of War,"This was one of my favourite Game of Thrones episodes of all time, there was not one moment (except maybe for the Littlefinger / Bran scene) that i did not enjoy throughout. The Stark reunion, Arya vs Brienne, Cersei talking to Iron Bank and especially Jon showing Dany the carvings in the wall was just amazing.... But that last 15 minutes? F*cking hell i have never been so tense for anything in my life, that be on cinema or on the small screen. One of the best action scenes i have ever seen and you can just see where the money is being put this episode. The part where Bronn was aiming at Drogon // Jaime charging towards Daenerys were two of the most stressful but incredible scenes of the entire show. Even Tyrion was watching! Quite nice how he was trying to tell Jaime to ""flee"", even though they are at war. Definitely the best episode of the season (so far). Cant wait to see how Cersei reacts to this... Not sure how the gold got to Kings Landing safely though the grain/harvest from Highgarden was still with Jaime at the Reach? 

Also, that POV shot ontop of the Dothraki horse looking at the collision of the Lannister army was amazing... 10/10 episode. 

EDIT: After watching the episode a couple more times, i actually really like the Littlefinger/Bran scene. Especially the ""death is a ladder"" followed by Petyr's amazing facial expression. Maybe the first time i watched it I just didnt understand it fully. "

7,4,The Spoils of War,"That speech Jon gave Daenerys about how if she uses her dragons to burn cities she's no different to anyone else was so good. Even made me a bit emotional because Jon really is the better ruler and I'm convinced he's going to end up as the king on the end. He has to. I think that's what the conversation with Missandei was about too. How in some cultures they don't even have such a thing as bastards, and how Daenerys's people chose her. All these people talking about birthright and wondering how Jon's true parents will even come into play unless they were secretly married. I don't think it's going to matter in the end. People are going to chose to follow Jon regardless. He will be the King. It's been hinted at a few times now. Like when Sansa said Jon is good at ruling. Or when Jon said he doesn't like to do what he's good at. He was probably talking about fighting/killing, but the other thing he's good at that he doesn't want to do is ruling. And that's why he'd make a better ruler than Daenerys. Jon is destined to become King."

He conspired with Robert’s brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me very well and provide me with every comfort. I beg you: come to King’s Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark.""

Cersei is pregnant...maybe, I'm not buying it.

Jaime is okay

But most importantly....

JON TOUCHED THE DRAGON"
7,5,Eastwatch,"Jon pet Drogon. Gilly read about Rhaegar's secret annulment and re-marriage in Dorne. Jon isn't actually a bastard? 

#99.99% CONFIRMED COME ON D&D STOP TEASING US! I WANT THE CHARACTERS TO KNOW!
"
7,5,Eastwatch,"That’s confirmation folks - Jon is a Targaryen. Fire and Blood HYPE.
"
7,5,Eastwatch,"Holy shit so many talking points in this episode you guys!

• Jon and Gendry bonding over the friendship their fathers used to share. Little do they know that Gendry's father Robert killed Jon's real father Rhaegar. I wonder how that knowledge would affect their relationship.

• On that note, we finally got confirmation of Rhaegar actually marrying Lyanna. Which means Jon is NOT just a bastard from two royal houses, but is in fact the true heir to the Iron Throne.

• Dany burning the Tarlys alive and beginning her reign of fire and fear in Westeros gave me both a boner and the feels at the same time. Especially when Randyll held Dickon's hand in the face of death :( But every motherfucker out there bent the knee after they saw what happened to their Lord and his son

• Jorah coming back to Dany, and the whole dynamic between Jon and Jorah. Also, when Dany bade farewell to them at the beach, she was literally saying goodbye to the only two men in her life she has feelings for. What a moment that was. 

• Dany looking at Jon with such passion in her eyes and saying ""You do not have my permission to leave"" when Jon told them he was going beyond the Wall was everything. And then Jon with ""Forgive me, your grace, but I don't need your permission. I am a king"". WOOOOO!

• Cersei's pregnancy and how this might change things will be very interesting to witness. The whole armistice idea is so cool, but I really hope Cersei's not so consumed with gaining an upper hand through the ceasefire that she completely ignores the threat North of the Wall. Also, who else is scared for Bronn now?

• Littlefinger putting the two Stark sisters against each other. Holy shit I did NOT see that coming. The slyest man in Westeros still has a few tricks up his sleeve, apparently. Really, really hoping this doesn't end with one of the sisters killing the other 🤞🏽

• Lastly, that last scene of Jon and his band of merry men marching out into the wintry wastelands beyond the Wall was so fucking cool and foreboding. The preceding scene of their confrontation in the cell was also really well done. It was so cool how each started recognizing the other (Jon recognizing the Hound, Gendry recognizing the Brotherhood, Thoros recognizing Set Jorah, Tormund realizing that the son of the man who had hunted them for a long time was standing right next to him). Really liked Berric Dondarrion's speech about all of them being at the edge of the world at the same time for the same purpose. Something really fateful and poetic about that, like this is exactly how it was meant to be.

Share your thoughts about the points I mentioned, and add any that you think I might have missed. Can't wait for Episode 6 now! But then again, I say that about every episode every week lol 🐺"

7,5,Eastwatch,"Here I thought Gendry's return was kind of cool. I probably would have liked it more if it was not so belated. Sure, hearing the rowing joke made me chuckle a bit, but nothing particularly excited me about the return of everyone's favorite blacksmith.

"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Going to call this right now - if you look at [Viserion's eyes](https://i.imgur.com/O7FO6fb.jpg), the way they're depicted is much more in line with the white walker eyes (reference the [WW baby](https://i.imgur.com/MbGp95z.jpg)) than the foggy blue wight eyes.  Also, the resurrection was accomplished with a touch, not from a distance as he did at Hardhome - again, like Craster's kid.  The dragon, either by the NK's choice or because dragons are special snowflakes, is the same sort of thing the WW's are and not merely a wight.  

Not sure what this *means*, but it's at least an indication in favor of ice breath given the WW's power to summon cold.  "

7,6,Beyond the Wall,RIP to all those theories on Jon and Tyrion becoming dragon riders alongside Danerys
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"At the end when Danaerys says, “You have to see it to know,” it can be interpreted so many different ways.  The most literal interpretation would be that she’s referring to the White Walkers and the army of the dead.  She feels ashamed for prioritizing taking the Iron Throne over facing the real threat.  Nobody believes Jon when he says the White Walkers are real.  Now that she has seen the enemy firsthand, she understands why Jon needs her help despite their differences.  


The second interpretation is that she has seen Jon’s bravery first hand.  She heard Davos hyping Jon up, and Jon telling Davos to stop.  She watched Jon fearlessly stay behind in an attempt to stop the Night King, knowing it would more than likely lead to his death.  It puts more perspective into why he has been named King in the North.  Despite king status, Jon is still willing to lead his men into battle, even when the battle is over before it starts. 



My last major interpretation of the quote is in regards to the stab wounds in Jon’s chest.  Every time it has been brought up, Jon has been quick to dismiss it.  Like Dany has been reborn from the flames, Jon has been reborn from the ice.  After Jon nearly drowns in a frozen lake, he still manages to return to Eastwatch.  At this point, Jon Snow cannot die.  When Dany see’s the scars she realizes that Jon is so humble that he does not use his resurrection to sell himself as a leader.  Every victory for Danaerys is just another extension to her lengthy title.  Jon has accomplished so much, but does not boast.  A true king’s respect is earned, not taken.  "

7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Tyrion: ""The most important person can't be in the most dangerous place""  
Dany: ""What do I do then with my beautiful white couture coat stitched especially to get Jon to bend my knee"""
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"“There was one javelin in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started throwing. And every throw I had to go up there and get my one javelin and walk back and throw it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. Could've been the 20th throw, or the 50th, I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye.”

**[AIR HORNS]**"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"So Dany saw Jon's bare chest and all the stab wounds he has and she expressed interest in Davos's words about Jon taking a knife to the heart for his people. So both Dany and Jon have escaped death, Dany in the first season when she walks out of the fire and Jon when he was brought back by the lord of light. I think that last scene definitely shows that a marriage is inevitable as the Northerners won't accept the King in the North to bend the knee, so joint power between Dany and Jon is the closest thing they'll accept.

Do you guys think that Viscerion will breathe fire or ice?

Also, the whole drama between Sansa and Arya seems entirely unnecessary and trope-y.  "
7,6,Beyond the Wall,I felt like every time someone needed to die some random red shirt walks out at the right time; literally the only time we see them are when they are dying.
7,6,Beyond the Wall,who's excited for a jamie/brienne meeting next week?
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Uncle Benjen coming to save Jon Snow actually makes sense. It's not just a shitty way to close up his plot line. It's foreshadowing the fact that Bran has actually learned how to control becoming the Three-eyed Raven. When Benjen comes and saves Bran and Meera, he states that the Three-eyed Raven had sent for him. We can only assume that the original Three-eyed Raven did this through some sort of supernatural communication, which has precedence via Bran communicating with Hodor. So, somehow, Bran learned how to communicate with him using his powers, and sent him to save Jon."
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Beric telling The Hound ""We'll meet again"" implies that The Hound is taking the wight down to King's Landing, right?

We shall never see his like again. And now, his watch is ended."
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Damn, Arya is paranoid as fuck. Shows in what kind of environment she grew up and how broken she is.

I doubt she really wants to hurt Sansa, she just doesn't want to lose more people she cares about to possible traitors.

She's pushing Sansa to the edge to see where her loyality is. That's why she wants to play the Game of Faces in the first place. A lot of people seem to ignore the purpose of the game, to see if she lies. She won't hurt Sansa; Arya just has massive trust issues after everything; Father executed, Friends getting killed, took as a prisoner by BwB/Friend betrayed and sold off, seeing mother/brother getting betrayed and killed, her time with the Hound and part of some magical crazy death cult.

She could easily kill her if she decides that Sansa is not trustworthy but instead she gives Sansa the dagger and turns her back to her. Pretty much a dead giveaway that she is/was just testing her. What is understandable after everything she's been trough. I really like her scenes.

Also the Night King. They absolutely knew the Dragons were coming, right? Just waiting there for the right moment. Seems like he has a similar power like Bran, seeing parts of the future.

7,6,Beyond the Wall,"After tonight's episode it seems clear to me that the Night King is aware of future events before it happens. 

If you watch closely, you'll see that the wights run faster than the group and circles them instead of running towards them. He wanted them alive.

Also, he patiently waited for the dragons to show up, even if he shouldn't be aware that they were coming.  He played with Jon and co, waited instead of using the spears he so conveniently brought with him.

7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Daenerys: The dragons are my children. They're the only children I'll ever have, do you understand?

Jon: [Challenge accepted.](http://commentphotos.com/gallery/CommentPhotos.com_1407121390.jpg)"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"I feel bad for you Viserion and I'ma let you finish, but let me just say that Hodor had the saddest death of the show. "
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"* I take offense on Hound’s hate on ginger people.

* That focus on Tormund tho almost gave me a heart attack, don’t do that again.

* Olympic Javelin athlete Night King targeting (I assume) Viserion was heartbreaking, **ICE DRAGON HYPE!**

* Drogon's zig zagging/dodging skill is getting better and better. 

* **UNCLE BENJEN! RIP. :(**

* **JON’S ABS**

* JON SAYS “MY QUEEN”, BENDS THE KNEE FIGURATIVELY AND THEY TOUCH HANDS.  **JONERYS HYPE!**"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,Night King chains supplied by Hardhome Depot.
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Before people Bitch about Dany getting there so quick please note.  
We saw the Time change from Day to Night to Day AT LEAST once.  
Now according to google a carrier Pigeon can travel 50 mph/80 kmk with Bursts of speed being higher,and travel up to 1100 miles/1770 Kilometers in a day.  
Back in Season 1 Maester Aemon states that they use Raven's because they are Faster,Stronger and can protect themselves. 

Now Dragonstone is at best guess 1900 miles from Eastwatch so lets say 1.75 days of non stop travelling for the Raven to get to Dragonstone.  
We saw The time go from Day to Night back to Day at least once so it is ""possible"" then we have to add in Danys flying time back up there but surprise surprise there does not seem to be a consensus on how fast mythical creatures can fly.  
Lets say They travel at least 4 times as fast as ravens (originally put 3 but that is wrong) due to their size and let's say Dany took 6 hours to get back to Eastwatch putting our total time at or near a little over 2 days (not including however long it took her to pick out the white outfit she changed into). 

So yes D&D attempted to get the ""teleporting"" right in this episode from what I can tell.  

The bigger question is Was the Army of the dead just carrying around those chains for the fuck of it, or does this prove that the NK is a Greenseer like Bran and knew they would be needed.  


Fixed a missed comma, that lead to people commenting about bursts of 1100 mph ya bunch of Top Knot wise asses"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Wtf is going on with Arya, I genuinely thought she was gonna hurt Sansa or worse. What would she mean by giving her the dagger?"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"
Why doesn't Bran just tell his sister's what's up?

Oh I forgot he ""hates drama""."

7,6,Beyond the Wall,"dany: ""heroes are dumb and do stupid shit to try and one up each other""  
also dany: ok tyrion i know you said this is a terrible idea but im gonna go be a hero haha bye"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,Was that the Night King or Drew fucking Brees..?
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Jon rides Rhaegal

Dany rides Drogon

Night King rides Viserion

Jon rides Dany ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,Viserion's screeches really hits me. The way he went down. The way Rhaegal follows him until he hits the ground. The way Drogon roars when Viserion was going down. Fuck. I cried. 
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Tormund the mighty warrior crying out for help was a humbling moment of character development. 

Please let him live long enough to make giant monster babies that conquer the world with Brienne. "
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Jon: ""Uncle Benjen, come with me!""

Benjen: ""There's no time!""

Jon: ""Just get on this horse with me and we'll both survive!""

Benjen: ""nah"""
7,6,Beyond the Wall,The plot armor Jon and Jamie are wearing must come with +100 aquatic survivability
7,6,Beyond the Wall,Beric's actor should get into narrating. He's got an awesome voice. Could listen to him talking about death being the enemy all day. 
7,6,Beyond the Wall,Anyone notice the exiled bear kills the dead bear?
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"I don't know about the rest of you, but to me this episode almost felt like the track and field portion of the Westerosi Olympics. The Night King won the javelin throw, the Hound won the shotput, and Gendry, the reigning rowing champion, won the marathon."
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Okay, so I'm not going to write a joke here but I have an idea I want to see get discussed.

Does anyone else think the NK *let* the fellowship stay on the ice because he was waiting for the dragons to come? Barring just bad writing, the NK could've just thrown ice spears at the group and not wait for the water to slowly freeze over. Alternatively, it is shown that possibly the NK could make things colder (as seen when he walks near a fire and it just dissipates), so hypothetically he could freeze the water whenever he wants to. 

One theory I'm thinking of is that the one wight they captured was under his control and that he could hear or see through it, learning that Jon sent someone to bring Daenerys and her dragons.

Another possibility is that he knew about the dragons ahead of time. Either because he can somehow see the future (greensight) or through Bran. It is not too big of a leap to think the NK and Bran are somehow linked because the earlier episode where the NK intercepted Bran using the weirwood and marked his arm (whether they are the same person is a different discussion). This could also explain Bran's cold demeanor: that the NK is corrupting him in some way, making him colder. Who knows, maybe Bran is going to be Team Ice. Or he can see things just like others can see things in fire.

Regardless of how he knew, the Polar Bear saw them early. Then the fellowship ""stumbles"" on a single WW with a handful of wights. Fishy."
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"My hands are shaking, what did I just see "
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"""I have a beauty waiting for me back in Winterfell.   
Yellow hair, blue eyes, tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you!""  
""Brienne of Tarth""  
""You know her?""  
""You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?!""  
""We'll, not with her yet. But I see the way she looks at me.""  
""How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?""  
""You do know her...""  
""We've met""  
""I want to make babies with her, think of em, great big monsters. They'd conquer the world""  
Find someone who loves you like Tormund does  
People are gonna talk about Viserion. But all I can think about is how badly I want Tormund and Brienne to be together  "
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Ever since ice dragons were mentioned in the books I've been dreaming of having the walkers use some. Now that we're here, I feel like I've had my wish granted by some sadistic genie and all I can think is [not like this](https://m.imgur.com/r/shittyreactiongifs/LOicMJA). Am I going regret wishing for the giant ice spiders as well? "
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"I love the fact that Tormund's opinion about Mance made Jon bend the knee, he didn't let his pride take over him. Well, he did that because Dany lost her son defending him too."
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Fucken an ice dragon, the fuck Night King has a dragon!!! Hope he uses it better than his giants. They would've pulled out Viserion out real quick."
7,6,Beyond the Wall,Where the hell did they get the chains?
7,6,Beyond the Wall,Can we take a moment to realize this historic meeting between dragons and the undead? two types of creature that bring so much fantasy in this entire story.
7,6,Beyond the Wall,Jon Snow has never won a battle in his entire life without someone swooping in at the last second to save him 
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"
Please tell me Arya has a plan because I did not like the way she was acting in this episode."
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Fuck it, I'm on the Dany Jon train now. "
7,6,Beyond the Wall, **ANOTHER STARK HAS FALLEN. UNCLE BENJEN :(**  It’s so hard to wear this flair.
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"And then the Night King said to the dragon, “Wolololo!”"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,Only GoT can make us wish for an incest plot line. 
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"THE NIGHT KING used Ice Spear! It's super effective!
***
VISERION fainted!
***
What? VISERION is evolving!
***
Congratulations! Your VISERION evolved into WIGHT VISERION!
"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"I stood up and cheered when Beric Dondarrion and Thoros ignited their swords and charged the undead bear. I didn't realize how much I needed that in my life.

I also can't believe I cried over a dragon, but, here we are..."
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"I’m utterly heartbroken over Viserion dying. The shriek he lets out as he’s falling. The blood spilling everywhere, the cries of devastation and morning from Drogon and Rhaegal as he’s falling, Rhaegal trying to fly with Viserion and break his fall, Dany’s look of heartbreak and shock, and Viserion slowly closing his eyes as he sinks into the water. I’m a sobbing mess. We’ve watched those little guys grow up since the first season. They’re like our pets, our children. Viserion’s death is as terrible to me as Ned’s. Excuse me while I ugly cry over this for the next few hours.

Furthermore, that moment on the boat with Dany and Jon was the most heartfelt and tender moment between two characters in this entire series. This is honestly the best done romance in the show.  Jon is totally going to get her pregnant btw. It was brought up twice that she couldn’t have children and Jorah tells Jon to give Longclaw to his children. If that isn’t a sledgehammer level of foreshadowing, I don’t know what is. The dragon must have three heads. She lost one of her three children. Jon will give her another.

7,6,Beyond the Wall,"[""We have to do with what we got.""](http://imgur.com/ATbb8aD)"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,That shot of the wights sinking into the lake and the music when Dany arrived gave me chills. Thank the gods for Ramin Djawadi.
7,6,Beyond the Wall,I'll put my vote in for the buddy cop movie with the hound and tormund with tyrion as their wise cracking captain. 
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"When Jon called her ""Dany"" I didn't think anything of it since we have been calling her that this entire time. I didn't realize only viserys called her it. "

7,6,Beyond the Wall,"* Littlefinger suggests Sansa use Brienne to ward off Arya.
* Sansa sends Brienne to King's Landing.
* Arya talks about taking Sansa's place (rudely, might I add).
* Arya turns the dagger over to Sansa.

They're on the same side and they don't even realize it yet.. or do they?"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Bran: ""You looked so beautiful, falling below the ice""

Jon: ""What the fuck"""
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Dany: I can never have children.

Jon: Challenge Accepted."
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"This was craziness. Night King didn't even flinch at the dragons.

This was a trap. He could've taken them out on the Little Rock island but was waiting for the dragons to arrive.

The back and forth with Tormund and the hound was great. We need a spin off of just this group of guys.
"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,Uncle Benjen died as he lived. As a plot device.
7,6,Beyond the Wall,[deleted]
7,6,Beyond the Wall,Why the hell did Jon keep fighting? was I the only one yelling at him to just stop fighting and run ?
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"**I know what you’re thinking**

**1.** The interactions in this episode were excellent.

**2.**The Wight Bear scene with the blinding snow, and Clegane literally freezing out of fear was great.

**3.** The music was top notch; the choir singing with the dragon fire was perfect.

**4.** Thoros was the best drunken priest in all of Westeros. 

**5.** Hearing Tormund scream for help made you feel uneasy.

**6.** Viserion died a better Targaryen than the person he was named after. RIP

**7.** Why did Olympic gold medal recipient, the Night King, not just hit Drogon with the First Javelin?

**8.** How did Gendry run to Eastwatch, send a raven, and have Dany come back in time to save them?

**9.** Is this guy a greenseer; how is he in my head? 
"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,A lot of references to Jon's children and Daenerys's heir. Only one way that can happen.

7,6,Beyond the Wall,"- Hey guys, is Jon x Dany going to happen, there's like no shipper moments this episode or anything. EDIT: Come on guys I shouldn't need the /s tag. There was literally a ship moment.

- I didn't realize they brought so many red shirts with them at the end of the last episode

- That's a really fucking cool trick with the flaming sword

- The Hound needs to learn not to draw aggro, especially if your res mage is dead

- ~~How did they have so much energy to fight after spending the night in that cold with minimal or no food?~~ Adrenaline is a hell of a drug

- Benjen with the out of nowhere 1 minute appearance

- Sansa: why are my siblings so creepy wtf???

- Something something Yu Gi Oh"

7,6,Beyond the Wall,"So, is Bran just on vacation this week? Plugged into a charger port or something?"
7,6,Beyond the Wall,"Tin foil hat: Littlefinger is already dead. Rewatch his scene guys, he is wooden, asks questions Arya wants to know, and talks about Brianne protecting both the Daughters ... I don't think Littlefinger knew that part of Brianne's vow."

7,6,Beyond the Wall,"I actually think that the way Arya behave is only to trick Littlefinger while using Sansa. She wouldn't have left her faces in a so obvious place if it wasn't part of a plan.
Actully I hope it's that, otherwise it's just horrible writing... :("
7,6,Beyond the Wall,So now we got two Charizards vs. A Dragonite.

7,6,Beyond the Wall,"The death of Viserion was utterly soul crushing. The explosion of fire followed by the fountain of blood gushing from his mortal wound was almost as hard to watch as Oberyn's death, which is impressive considering he's a computer generated fantasy creature. I was crying as he plummeted to the ice, a first for a non-human death.

This show isn't lacking in its flaws, but it never ceases to make me feel harder than any other tv show/movie, be it dread, jubilation or utter devastation. I fucking love Game of Thrones."

"
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"Holy fuck that Jaime - Cersei scene was extremely tense. I legit thought she was going to order him to be executed, especially considering she refused to kill one brother before, it would have been sadly poetic if she killed the one she actually loved."

7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"So if Ned Stark revealed Jon Snow's identity to the world, it would have been understood that the Rebellion happened over a lie, and thousands needlessly died.

What a fucking burden of a secret to keep."
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"It appears Tyrion’s assessment was correct.

EDIT: Grammar"
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"""The only one who needs protecting is the one who gets in her way."" 

""Won't be me.""

Loved that proud little almost fatherly smile that came over The Hound's face when Brienne told him that Arya is alive and well and kicking ass in Winterfell. "
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"What I love about this season is how much Ned Stark is still contributing to the story. His honesty and integrity to keep his word led to Jon Snow to being honest at the pit, Arya and Sansa to remember his famous saying about their family, Theon's bravery to confront his men, and even Jon's secret that has kept him safe all these years at great cost. 

Ned is such an important character and this episode really drove that home 

EDIT: Not only affecting Theon's choices, he's the one that practically took him on as a son to begin with. He also advised against murdering the Targaryen children, which leads us to where we are now with Dany. And he recognized and encouraged Arya's interest in fighting, which led to her choices to become a great weapon in the fight (and also her knowledge to recognize Little finger's shit). Ned is definitely a story catalyst in many ways "
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Since Bran has just casually finished Season 1 I can't wait to hear his thoughts on the Battle of the Blackwater next year. 
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"One interesting reunion I'm predicting is Jaime and Bran, assuming he's riding north to Winterfell.

7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Anybody else had a minor heart attack when the Mountain pulled the sword on Jaime?
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Jaime leaving Cersei with the snowflake landing on his glove was all I needed in this season and it finally happened. Just as beautiful as it was in the book (minus the letter of course).

7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"The suspense in the great hall scene made up for any shortcomings in the Winterfell plot line.  I really thought Arya was going to fight 50 people at once, and then I got to see Littlefinger turn into a little bitch AND I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT."
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"Okay call me crazy, and I *really* hope I'm wrong...but is it possible Tyrion betrayed Dany? Something about his whole arc in this episode is off-putting to me. He realized Cersei was pregnant, then we cut back to the pit and Cersei lies about the truce to Dany and Jon. We never saw the rest of their conversation, and he even remarked that he has influence over Dany because she trusts his judgment. Then, toward the end of the episode, he's lurking outside her door. The look on his face just didn't sit right with me. I'm probably reaching here, but any thoughts?"
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"""And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through""

7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"Well I have to give it to them, D&D certainly didn't leave us fucking hanging. Shit has hit the fan.

On a side note, I like that they killed Littlefinger, it's kind of symbolic of the fact that all this political bullshit, that has been the entire premise of the show for most of these characters, is no longer important. "

"
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"- That scene with Cersei and Tyrion. The way Tyrion's voice was breaking, holy shit! One of the best scenes this season.

- The Hound had a small smile when Brienne was telling him about how formidable Arya has become. That was oddly heartwarming. 

- Cersei was legitimately terrified, first time we've seen that in a while. 

- Theon flipped the script on that dude so heart. When he was getting kicked in the groin and not feeling anything, you could see Theon smirking a little

- Littlefinger finally got the justice that's been coming for him since Season 1. Poetic justice that the blade that started the entire conflict of the show turned against him.

- That's going to be an awkward convo with Bran, Jon, and Dany

- That last scene at the Wall. Wow. No words. The Great War is here"

The Wall falling was as chilling an image as I've ever seen on this show.

7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"If Jaime has left... does that mean Bronn will soon follow suit? If so, could we finally get Tyrion, Jaime and Bronn as the holy trinity?!"

7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"Jon: Think about it. She’s out in the middle of nowhere with some dude she barely knows. She looks around her, what does she see? Nothing but open ocean. “Oh, there’s nowhere for me to run, what am I gonna do, say no?”

Tyrion: ...

Jon: If my Queen said no, then the answer obviously is no. The thing is that she’s not gonna say no, she’d never say no…because of the implication."
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Theon wailing on that guy was giving me some Scott Farkus shit kicking vibes from Christmas Story.

7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"I actually really liked the new detail about Bran from his convo with Sam about the annulment and wedding. His greensight doesn't make him omnipotent. He CAN go back and see things, but he had to know what to look for. He can't just go back and watch all of time and space and hope to see things that were important. 

Of course he knows how Littlefinger's interactions with Ned went, that was his father and he obviously wanted to know what really happened. It was probably one of the earliest things he went and saw with his abilities when he got to Winterfell, along with what happened to the rest of his family. "

7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,I honestly think that Littlefinger’s death was the most satisfying thing in this entire fucking series.
7,7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"Best part about this episode, is that all the complaints people were making about the season, about Bran not telling anyone anything, about Arya apparently being an idiot for the things she was saying and being baited by Littlefinger, about extended dialogue between characters who know each other, and about why the White Walkers were taking so long to get to the wall, were completely squashed.

8,1,Winterfell,That was way faster of a rescue of Yara than I ever anticipated.
8,1,Winterfell,"I find it extremely funny when the characters don't know how to act around or how to describe Bran lol. Jon said he's a man now and Bran said ""Almost."" Jon Snow was like: "".........What?"" And Sansa's smirk with side eye was as if she said ""Lol just go along with it no one gets him."""
8,1,Winterfell,"there was some parts of this episode that resembled horror movies, like in last hearth. But the creepiest part is just Bran showing up everywhere"
8,1,Winterfell,The Hound Arya reunion was so fucking cold it was actually heartwarming
8,1,Winterfell,That was the angriest I've ever seen Sam.
8,1,Winterfell,Anyone gonna do Bran a solid and roll him out of the courtyard?
8,1,Winterfell,"Bran: THERE’S NO TIME
Also Bran: *Waits in courtyard all episode*"
8,1,Winterfell,"Lord Glover and flaking out when the time matters, name a more iconic duo."
8,1,Winterfell,"""And Bran with... whatever Bran has..."" - Sam

Great line lol"
8,1,Winterfell,I love how Jon Snow “died” in the Stark crypt.
8,1,Winterfell,"""It's a message from the Night King."" 

yeah i think he doesn't like us"
8,1,Winterfell,Cersei really wanted those elephants
8,1,Winterfell,The screaming meat wheel at the end is an interesting decor choice
8,1,Winterfell,"> That fucking family


Bronn just now realizing the Lannisters are the most fucked up family ever created"
8,1,Winterfell,'You're just a cold heard bitch aren't you? That's why you're still alive.' just about the nicest thing the Hound has ever said
8,1,Winterfell,"Bran: “no time, the dead have broken through the wall”

Jon and Dany: “a whole neeewwww worrrlllddd”"
8,1,Winterfell,"Bran - the crypts aren't ada accessible, so you're gonna have to go tell Jon."
8,1,Winterfell,"Bran: ""We don't have time for this. Don't you guys know there are only 6 episodes this season?"""
8,1,Winterfell,Only reason Bran didn't want to tell Jon he was a Targaryen was cause last time he discovered an incestuous plot at Winterfell he was pushed outta a 5 story window
8,1,Winterfell,"Watching Sam struggle not to cry in front of Dany was brutal, poor Sam."
8,1,Winterfell,Did Theon sail to fucking Rivendell to get those archers? That was some seal team 6 shit
8,1,Winterfell,I love that Jon got told the truth straight away.
8,1,Winterfell,There’s something about Jon with women near waterfalls 🤔

&#x200B;

""Which girl?""

&#x200B;

Asking the important questions, Bronn."
8,1,Winterfell,"He may have been your father, but he wasnt your daddy - Samwell Tarley"
8,1,Winterfell,"I really really loved how Jon’s first thought was not that Sam was lying or anything - his thoughts went straight to Ned.

The show has done so well in making Ned Stark still a vibrant part of the show’s soul even eight years after his death. It’s really incredible.

And Jon in general is just the best. He doesn’t doubt Sam or Bran for one instant."
8,1,Winterfell,"Everyone else: *feels emotions*

Bran: ( ͡° _ʖ ͡°)"
8,1,Winterfell,">Lord Umber nailed to the wall.  

Well that's more than a little creepy

8,1,Winterfell,Of all the ‘reunions’ I hadn’t even thought of Bran and Jaime.
8,1,Winterfell,"as usual i get mad and yell ""what!?"" when the credits start to roll"

8,1,Winterfell,"""sorry for throwing you from that tower, lol"""
8,1,Winterfell,Jamie's look as he realized he was looking at Bran.
8,1,Winterfell,Bran is like the Dungeon Master watching all the characters screw up the campaign.
8,1,Winterfell,I fucking love the queen coming to congratulate sam but telling him she murdered his family. sam played it perfectly as to not be disrespectful but showing the severity of her actions through raw emotion. such a powerful scene.
8,1,Winterfell,That opening animation was awesome tho
8,1,Winterfell,Bran has been serving looks this whole episode it’s hilarious.
8,1,Winterfell,Damn that over the shoulder shot of Tormund and the Ned Umber wight was so freaky.  When you see his eyes open and turn blue man yikes so hype.
8,1,Winterfell,"""IM NEVER CALLING HIM DAD""- Drogon. Probably."
8,1,Winterfell,"Tyrion to Sansa: Last time we spoke was at Joffery's wedding, miserable affair.

Sansa: It had it's moments

omg LOL"

""I've always had blue eyes!""

lmao Tormund got me with this line"
8,1,Winterfell,"So did Bran spend the whole night waiting for Jaime?

Edit: Fixed Jaime's name"
8,1,Winterfell,Who allowed this episode to be 50 minutes what is this
8,1,Winterfell,"""Waiting for an old friend""

Did NOT think he was talking about Jaime"
8,1,Winterfell,Why aren't there any wheelchair ramps in Winterfell they left Bran in the courtyard overnight smh
8,1,Winterfell,"Surprise mother fucker

&#x200B;

\-Bran"
8,1,Winterfell,"I thought the actor that played Sam was fucking hitting grand slams tonight. The five minute stretch when he sees Dany and then Jon was unreal. 

“You gave your crown to save your people... would she do the same?” is A+++++"
8,1,Winterfell,"Who the fuck is moving Bran around to all these places?  
""Is that good?""  
""A little to the left. Yeah, that's perfect.""  
""Should... should I stay?""  
""No, it'll be cooler if I just sit here alone. Pick me up in like fifteen minutes."""
8,1,Winterfell,"Bran: “Sup.”

Jaime: “Oh shit oh fuck.”"
8,1,Winterfell,After becoming a somewhat lovable character it took 10 seconds of Jaime on screen with Bran for us to remember how horrible he was. That’s one of the things that makes GoT so amazing.
8,1,Winterfell,"> I’m waiting for an old friend

Holy shit Bran"
8,1,Winterfell,"""Poor girl, pox will take her within the year”
""Which girl""  


LMFAO"
8,1,Winterfell,"Honestly the kid didn’t scare me. 

Cersei having to have sex with Uncle Greyjoy after months at sea without a shower is the true horror of this episode."
8,1,Winterfell,"Daenerys: I killed your father  
Sam: Well At least I still have my brother  
Daenerys: Oooo... about that...."
8,1,Winterfell,"Jaimie: Yo, nice place you got here folks

Bran:

Jaimie: fuck"
8,1,Winterfell,"I’VE ALWAYS HAD BLUE EYES

Will root for you always, Tormund"
8,1,Winterfell,"I don’t think you understand, bro, I’ve been fucking her all this time."
8,1,Winterfell,That Arya Jon reunion was beautiful.
8,1,Winterfell,"""Can't wait to see my dad""

""Yeahhh about that kid""

""Well I got my brother at least!""

awkwardface.jpg"
8,1,Winterfell,OKAY HOLD UP. IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW DANNY SAID THE SAME LINE AS YGRITTE IN THE WATERFALL.
8,1,Winterfell,"Jaime looked very not Lannister at the end of this episode. Brownish hair, dirty clothes."
8,1,Winterfell,This show's CGI budget is fucking ridiculous.
8,1,Winterfell,The stripped down theme music when Jon made the realization that Sam was telling the truth. Perfection.
8,1,Winterfell,I’m so glad Dany told Sam. That was so sad but the best way for him to find out.
8,1,Winterfell,The live action of How To Train Your Dragon is pretty NSFW.
8,1,Winterfell,"""Hello mate, I guess that was my bad back in that tower"""
8,1,Winterfell,"I loved all the parallels between this episode and the pilot

-	The opening shot of the King/Queen arriving with the same music
-	Arya being a kid watching the King coming vs her letting a kid get a good view of the Queen coming
-	Jamie arriving at Winterfell taking a Golden Lannister Helmet off showing his blonde hair, clean shaven, and everyone staring at him vs arriving in gray cloaks and taking a hood off to show darker hair and a beard and no one except Bran noticing him. /u/Renetelli made [this awesome post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bdc61u/spoilers_the_contrast_between_s1e1_and_s8e1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)
-	Both episodes ending with Bran and Jamie, except this time Jamie looks scared and Bran looks confident, the reverse of the Pilot. 
-	Both episodes have scenes with amputated limbs from the white walkers spread out in a gory way to send a message
-	Both episodes have scenes in the Winterfell crypt except instead of visiting Lyanna Stark they are visiting Ned Stark. 
-	In the pilot Cersi and Catlyn Stark talk about their kids possibly getting married while looking at them from a distance, while in this episode Varys, Tyrion, and Davos talk about Dany and Jon getting married while looking at them from a distance
-	The kid from the beginning was climbing on trees to get a good view, similar to Bran climbing the castle to get a good view. From /u/jbongi14 he also looked similar to Bran in the Pilot
-	In the Pilot all the shots of Winterfell showed the grass but now it’s all snow covered. 
-	The Greyjoy’s repeating their family words much like the Starks did in the pilot (I know it’s kind of a reach). E: it’s not actually their family words but something the Ironborn say regularly. 
-	From /u/Dawnshroud The reunion of Jon and Arya at the tree is similar to Ned at Catlyn at the tree
-	~~From /u/molotov1g ”S1E1's title is ""Winter is Coming"", S8E1's title is ""Winter is Here""”~~. This is not true, it is actually titled “Winterfell” which can be interpreted as “Winter Fell” or “Winter has fallen”, serving a similar purpose. 
-	From /u/enfinnity there was incest between visiting monarchs and from /u/blacktwin Bran watched both incestuous acts from S1E1 and S8E1. If you can believe the staring dragon was controlled by Bran.
-	From /u/enfinnity the brothel scene with Bron is similar to Tyrion’s first scene
-	From /u/JaqueStrap69 Also Jon asking Sansa ""Where's Arya?"" When he arrived, just like Ned asking ""Where's Arya?""
-	From /u/ChavaF1 The current ruler of winterfell saying “Winterfell is yours” to the arriving monarch
-	From /u/sarahj2010 Also loved the line from Robert Baratheon in the pilot to Ned 'I have a son, you have a daughter, we shall join our houses'. Its gotta be Arya and Gendry.
-	From /u/SaiyanAintSo Also Sansa being more than wary of Dany, much like Catlyn was of Cersei. She really seemed like her mother in that meet and greet
-	From /u/Dualstack Also Robert asking Ned to be his hand in the crypts kind of similar to Sam telling Jon he is king in the crypts
-	**HUGE** one from /u/Itsgreenarrow Also S1E1 Ned’s farewell to Jon he says “the next time we see each other, We will talk about your mother. I promise.” Then S8E1 while Jon is staring at Neds tomb Sam tell him about his parents
-	From /u/friggindiggin First episode Jon is distraught over his identity crisis as a bastard. This episode Jon is distraught over his identity crisis as a king.
-	From /u/Skeetronic Don’t forget Cersei putting out to someone she’s not ‘loyal’ to
-	From /u/TheLoganSullivan The last time Jon and Arya spoke in episode one, she was given her sword Needle and jumped up on Jon to hug his neck. In this episode, she jumps up to hug his neck, then shows him she still has Needle.
-	From /u/itsathrowaway416 Another thing paralleling Sansa/Dany to Catelyn/Cersei is Dany complimenting the north and sansa (“the north is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you”) , and Cersei calling the north “beautiful country” and saying to Sansa “you are a beauty”. Just incredibly similar imo, too much to be a coincidence
-	From /u/s3ntoki Also from S1E1: The whole family standing in line for the king. In S8E1: The remaining Starks and their advisors waiting for the queen and Jon
-	From /u/No-One-In-Particular More general parallel but Sam and Jon are the new Ned and Robert. Sam/Ned - father and brother burned alive by the mad Queen/King. ALSO supporting the kingship of Jon/Robert. Jon/Robert - great warriors, “brothers” to Sam/Ned, and both vying for the iron throne but ALSO both doing it for reasons beyond wanting the throne (protecting the realm / saving Liana and removing the mad king)
-	In S1E1 Jon snow gets a pet Direwolf (Stark), in SE8E1 Jon Snow gets a pet Dragon (Targaryen). From someone’s username I can’t copy on mobile sorry lol
-	From /u/grandmaofhurt Adding to the arrival at Winterfell, the only person that rode in both caravans was The Hound. In the first one he wore his trademark dog helm, but this time he wore nothing. It seems to symbolize his transition away from The Hound and to being himself, Sandor Clegane.
-	From /u/frangadilla Also, episode one the surprising return of and existence of dire wolves south of the wall shocking the northerners and now we have the return of and arrival of dragons also shocking the seemingly implacable northerners
-	From /u/kawkasaurous Random but sansa mentions feeding the greatest army just like Caitlyn did.
-	From /u/ohnoguts The lady of Winterfell (Sansa) reading a letter by candlelight vs the OG lady of Winterfell (Catelyn) reading a letter by candlelight
-	From /u/windyskies The parallel and inversion of Sansa's response to Cersei vs her response to Dany. If Cersei taught her anything, it's not to blindly trust a beautiful queen coming into Winterfell and promising to protect her and fulfill her wildest dreams."
8,1,Winterfell,Jamie's face when he realizes who the kid in the wheelchair is...unbelievable acting
8,1,Winterfell,"That was TOO SHORT.

Edit: I gotta ask: was that [what she said?](https://i.imgur.com/EBO0oYz.png)"
8,1,Winterfell,"Look, obviously Winterfell falls. They brought everyone back together just to shatter them all apart next episode."
8,1,Winterfell,"All I hoped for was Jaime & Bran encountering each other. And I got it in Episode 1. That was fantastic. ""I'm waiting for an old friend."""
8,1,Winterfell,JAIME IS THE OLD FRIEND DAMN
8,1,Winterfell,I’m enjoying the many looks of “wtf” on everybody’s face when they interact with Bran for the first time.
8,1,Winterfell,Bran staring simulator 2019
8,1,Winterfell,"Damn, I wasn't expecting Jon to ride TWO dragons in this episode"
8,1,Winterfell,BIG props for HBO on having enough servers to stream flawlessly.
8,1,Winterfell,Not a great way to introduce yourself by telling someone you killed their father and their brother lol
8,1,Winterfell,"I can understand the dragons lack of appetite due to climate, but I thought the better explanation would be grief over losing viserion"
8,1,Winterfell,The way Bran looked at Tyrion while he was talking to Sansa hints something bigger than just the truce with Cercei
8,1,Winterfell,That umber boy made me shat my pants
8,1,Winterfell,Damn Bran waited a long time just to mean-mug Jaime...
8,1,Winterfell,"The Bran + Jon reunion:

Jon: ""Look at you, you're a man.""

Bran: ""Almost.""

Jon: *Visible confusion.*

&#x200B;

What did Bran mean by that?"
8,1,Winterfell,"‘The wedding had its moments’. 

Awesome.

Edit: Wow! Thanks for silver. What a great way to start the week."
8,1,Winterfell,"So noticed something and wanted to get everyone else's take on it. When Sam is telling Jon about his true parentage in the crypts, it focuses on Jon with Ned Stark's statue in the background.

It really reminded me of the Jon and Ned parting conversation. ""The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother."" I didn't do a rewatch, so I can't recall if Jon visited his father's statue before, but it really seemed like a nice touch to me.

Edit: A few people have pointed out to me that Jon had a scene with Littlefinger in the crypts last season, so that kind of takes away from my point haha. I do still like the framing with Ned and then Lyanna's statues though, and think it's very reminiscent of that scene."
8,1,Winterfell,I have a feeling that knowing his birthright now info is gonna get out and Jon’s gonna end up on the throne just for the sole reason that he’s the one who wants it the least
8,1,Winterfell,"John Bradley was the MVP this episode. His scene with Daenerys and Jorah was fantastic; his acting when he realized his father was dead, his trying to look on the bright side before the news of his brother's death hit...probably my fave scene of him.

In general the episode was just solid tbh, very enjoyable. I'm very curious about Bronn, as it looks like he's being set up for some kind of arc where he has to decide between his amoral cutthroat nature and the two men who were pretty much the only people to ever give a shit about him. I'm excited for that as well, even if it becomes increasingly obvious that they can't have Cersei and Bronn's actors in the same scene together.

So yeah overall pretty dang good"
8,1,Winterfell,"Surprisingly covered a lot more in the first episode than I thought!

Targ Jon, Jon riding a dragon, plus Arya meeting Jon, the Hound, and Gendry again.

Also loved Bran in the beginning - “we don’t have time for this” felt very meta haha."
8,1,Winterfell,"Im actually starting to doubt if Daenerys makes it out, backstab time"
8,1,Winterfell,That aerial shot of Winterfell in the beginning of the episode was dope af.
8,1,Winterfell,[deleted]
8,1,Winterfell,"Sansa: What do dragons eat, anyway?

# Daenerys: Whatever they want."
8,1,Winterfell,AEGON THE TRUE KING OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS
8,1,Winterfell,"Did anyone see the dragon riding scene and go ""They are definately making a GoT ride at Universal...""?"
8,1,Winterfell,Bran is probably the only person in Winterfell who doesn't give a shit that Jaime pushed him off a tower.
8,1,Winterfell,Jon riding Rhaegal for the first time felt like Harry Potter's first time flying on a broomstick
8,1,Winterfell,"*Hooded figure on horse*

""oh I know who that could be""

*Jamie reveal and he turns to see Bran*

""oh fuck, DONT YOU DARE END THE EPISODE RIGHT THERE""

*camera slowly zooms on Bran*

""NO NO NO NO, DONT FUCKING DO IT""

*black*

[my reaction](http://i.imgur.com/zdDEnR7.gif)"
8,1,Winterfell,"I think theyre all gonna end up killing each other and the night king is gonna be like ""oh well whatever"" and then it ends"
8,1,Winterfell,I kinda want Bran and Jaime to become best buds now
8,1,Winterfell,"If Jon Snow just watched the show 100 times like everyone else he'd realize that Ned said ""you may not have my name, but you have my blood."""
8,1,Winterfell,"The ending of Season 1 Episode 1 finally comes full circle with the ending of Season 8 Episode 1.

EDIT: For people that don't remember. Season 1 Episode 1 ended like [this](https://racefortheironthrone.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/tower.jpg)."
8,1,Winterfell,"No one:

Umber boy: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
8,1,Winterfell,Where is Ghost?
8,1,Winterfell,"Poor Jon can't catch a break. Reunites with his family, they're all kinds of fucked up. His sister hates his new girlfriend. His best friend surprises him then tells him his girlfriend is a psycho and also his aunt and that they need to seriously reevaluate their relationship"
8,1,Winterfell,FREE GHOST
8,1,Winterfell,"JON SNOW KNOWS SOMETHING

Edit: Thanks for my first ever Silver AND GOLD WOW!!!!!! I knew my shitposting would get me somewhere!"
8,1,Winterfell,"“thx for saving my sidepiece... btw I killed your dad”

-daenerys, probably"
8,1,Winterfell,"Have you ever used it?

Arya: Once or twice.

*My queen*

Edit: *No one* is grateful for the silver!"
8,1,Winterfell,I have always got blue eyes
8,1,Winterfell,"That dead Umber boy scene was brutal...

I liked how they introduced him and everything. Shouldnt have liked him so fast..."
8,1,Winterfell,I'm not sure Jon processed that he has been fucking his aunt with everything that was going on lmao
8,1,Winterfell,Bran was like yeah bitch ass dude I'm alive
8,1,Winterfell,We're back in lads hold the fuck on.
8,1,Winterfell,Where is Brianne of Tarth?
8,1,Winterfell,The new opening title gave me CHILLS. I can't imagine the time and effort it went into animating all the cogs and wheels and moving parts.
8,1,Winterfell,"The Cersei ""how disappointing"" line about elephants broke the 4th wall. I wanted elephants damnit."
8,1,Winterfell,Sam is the narrator and protagonist
8,1,Winterfell,"Wow

""You gave up your crown to save your people....Would she do the same?""



edit: Thank you for the gold kind stranger.

So happy I am back with my people!"
8,1,Winterfell,"Dany: I'm afraid your father is dead. He wouldn't bend the knee.

Sam: Well, he was kind of a dick, at least I'll get to go back home and see my brother!

Dany: Yeah, so.. about that...I kinda roasted him alive too...

Sam: :l"
8,1,Winterfell,I love that Jon rode Rheagal who is named after his father.
8,1,Winterfell,"My favorite exchange:

Cersei: You're insolent. I've executed men for less.

Euron: They were lesser men

Euron knows how to talk to Cersei better than anyone else"
8,1,Winterfell,Just realized the reason Qyburn spoke to Bronn for Cersei was likely because Jerome Flynn and Lena Headey have conflicts and don’t often do scenes together
8,1,Winterfell,They deadass left Bran outside.
8,1,Winterfell,"""... I am her queen"" -  Daenerys Targaryen(S8E1)

""Any (wo)man who must say I am the king(queen), is no true king(queen)."" - Tywin Lannister(S3E10)"
8,1,Winterfell,"""My eyes have always been blue!"" Tormund was only in the episode for 2 minutes and had the best line."
8,1,Winterfell,Bran sitting creepily out of frame for every character is totally going to become a thing isn't it.
8,1,Winterfell,Why is no one talking about Jon and Dany acting like a high school couple in an active war zone?
8,1,Winterfell,If Lena can't get an Emmy can we at least get her a FUCKING ELEPHANT.
8,1,Winterfell,[deleted]
8,1,Winterfell,Who keeps moving Bran and forgetting about him?
8,1,Winterfell,Explain an episode plot badly: “Bran stares at people while waiting for an old friend”
8,1,Winterfell,"Cersei: I wanted elephants.

&#x200B;

Me: me too, bitch, me too"
8,1,Winterfell,"Anyone else annoyed that they never actually resolved the ""how are we going to feed all these people"" question?? A snarky line from Dany does not clear this up for me I want answers"
8,1,Winterfell,Calling it.. Arya hits the Night King with a dragon glass tipped arrow
8,1,Winterfell,"""the pox will take that girl soon""

""which girl""

&#x200B;

NO GLOVE NO LOVE BRON"
8,1,Winterfell,"Dany to Sam: I killed your father and brother.

Sam: Your're fucking your nephew."
8,1,Winterfell,"I'm pretty sure Qyburn said ""brothers,"" not just ""brother.""

Cersei wants to kill Tyrion *and* Jaime.... wow.

Edit: Yup, just went back and checked.

Edit 2: Do y'all think Bronn will actually hurt Jaime... even if gold is on the line?"
8,1,Winterfell,"Bran to Jaime: ""You looked beautiful when you pushed me out of that window while fucking your sister"""
8,1,Winterfell,Holy shit Ned Umbers screams fucked my shit up man
8,1,Winterfell,"Drogon basically being the stern dad giving that look to Jon saying ""you better have my daughter back before midnight""."
8,1,Winterfell,That intro was fucking nice.
8,1,Winterfell,That symbol the kid was in was children of the forest yeah?
8,1,Winterfell,I guess the Golden Company Elephants didn't make the CGI budget this year.
8,1,Winterfell,"Jon's face after Sam told him the truth. Was it because he learned he's not a Stark? Learned he's the rightful heir of the Seven Kingdoms?

Nope. That's the face of a man who just realized he fucked his aunt.

Edit: Yes, everyone. I know he's technically half Stark."
8,1,Winterfell,Sam crying may be the saddest thing this show has ever given us
8,1,Winterfell,"Anyone else thinking there is something to the similarity of the white walkers ""spiral"" design and the Targaryen sigil?"
8,1,Winterfell,"*Jaime looks at Bran*

Bran: “I lived, bitch.”"
8,1,Winterfell,"Can we take a second to acknowledge how bomb Maise Williams has been lately? She just sells the straight faced assassin so well, then when the facade breaks and she reveals the girl beneath, it always feels natural and puts a smile on my face.

That girl has come a very long way since season 1. She's got some real talent and the older she gets the more it comes through. The character he played in Doctor Who was pretty great for her age as well."
8,1,Winterfell,"“You left me to die”

“First I Robbed you”

“You’re a Cold Little Bitch” 

Pretty much how I expected that reunion to go"
8,1,Winterfell,"Gotta say, great acting job by John Bradley. Really felt the emotion hit him when Daenerys broke the news about his family"
8,1,Winterfell,jesus christ that jump scare got me. I let out a yelp when he started screaming
8,1,Winterfell,"Everyone: Good to see you must have been an exhausting ride this...

Bran: Shut up losers the wall's down"
8,1,Winterfell,The new meme of the season has to be Bran just lurking in the background of everything. Staring at you.
8,1,Winterfell,"Good episode but can we talk about how fucking much the new intro slaps?

Edit: So there‘s a bit of confusion. „Slaps“ is meant in a good way. Check urban dictionary."
8,1,Winterfell,Jeez did Dany came across so unlikable in this episode.
8,1,Winterfell,"why did it feel so fucking short

also that was intense af wtf"
8,1,Winterfell," 

I think Jon is gonna kill Dany. The Prince that was Promised is said to have killed the woman he loves to kill the Nights King. Dany will find out about Jons parentage and, either by thinking its a lie or seeing him as a threat to her lifes mission, attempt to kill him or go to war with the north, and Jon will have to kill her in order to stop her from endangering the war against the dead.

Dany is the second woman he has ever been with and he will have to kill her. The first woman he was ever with he first met attempting to kill her, and when told to kill her by Qhorin he doesnt have the heart to do it. This time he cant be as merciful. Id bet anything this is part of where George was going with the story in the books as well, and that Jon meeting Ygritte like that was intentional foreshadowing."
8,1,Winterfell,Can we give some props to HBO for flawless streaming on what had to be a significantly heavy traffic event?
8,1,Winterfell,I was legit scared from that scene at the end
8,1,Winterfell,"Bran: We don't have time for this shit the dead are coming !

Also Bran: go tell him he's the rightful king and that he fucked his aunt LUL

Edit: Wow gold ! Thank you kind stranger, i wish you good fortune in the wars to come."
8,1,Winterfell,"""I'm your family too""

*Don't forget that*"
8,1,Winterfell,Disapproving Drogon stole the show.
8,1,Winterfell,"""Dude, gross.  That's you aunt.""

-Drogon & Rhaegal"
8,1,Winterfell,I hope Bran just chills in that one spot in the court of Winterfell all season
8,1,Winterfell,Does anyone else think that cersei had to fucked euron so every thinks her baby will be his?
8,1,Winterfell,Lady Mormont still can throw shade with the best of them.
8,1,Winterfell,"Lmao

“Oh you know my father?”

“Yep, burned him alive”

“Well at least my brother’s still alive”

“Ok so here’s the thing about that”"
8,1,Winterfell,"“I’m the only rich girl you’ve met”

“I’m going to put a prince in your belly”

“Keep your queen warm”

There’s some grade-A Tinder pick-up lines this episode"
8,1,Winterfell,I feel like all those lines about the elephants is just a small jest at HBO for blowing all their budget on dragons instead of putting some elephants in.
8,1,Winterfell,"*""Have you ever used Needle?""*

*""Let's not pull at that thread.""*"
8,1,Winterfell,"Is there a single person in Winterfell that doesn't want Jaime dead? Gonna be some awkward conversations next episode, lol."
8,1,Winterfell,"The Hound and Arya reunion was perfect, no more no less than needed. Sometimes scripts add unnecessary shit.

BTW Arya+ Gendry FTW!"
8,1,Winterfell,"No one:

Bran: 👀👀👀👀"
8,1,Winterfell,Love Brans constant blank facial expression lmao
8,1,Winterfell,"That can't be it!

Seriously tho, great episode. Reminds me of GoT of old."
8,1,Winterfell,Big props to Bran for moving the plot along btw.
8,1,Winterfell,"That was the most we’ve seen Arya smile like, ever and tbh it kinda creeped me out."
8,1,Winterfell,Gendry is totally going to discover that Valyrian steel = dragon glass + steel.
8,1,Winterfell,Bran was like ''I saw you that night. You were so beautiful''
8,1,Winterfell,Who else absolutely loved the updated intro?? Perfect way to start the last season
8,1,Winterfell,Man this season is going to move at breakneck speed
8,1,Winterfell,"That was too short you guys, we waited 2 years :("
8,1,Winterfell,"Harry Strickland: We don't have elephants

Cersei (and everyone else): That's disappointing"
8,1,Winterfell,Bran just sitting there and staring at everyone the entire episode lmao
8,1,Winterfell,Sansa’s line “It had it’s moments” about the purple wedding possibly funniest line of the show
8,1,Winterfell,"Great episode, but not nearly enough large rod Pod."
8,1,Winterfell,“Waiting for an old friend”
8,1,Winterfell,"""I sort of stole a sword from my father...""


""I have good news then. That sword is now rightfully yours."""
8,1,Winterfell,"""What is dead may never die""

""What is dead may never die""

**""But fucking kill the bastards anyway.""**
-

Ah my little Greyjoys.  Making the most out of the limited minutes you got on this episode."
8,1,Winterfell,"“Have you used it?”

“Once or twice.” 

Best line. If Jon only knew"
8,1,Winterfell,7 seasons of loving Danny and the scene with Sam just destroyed it all.
8,1,Winterfell,The hookers talking about Eddie the ginger with his eyelids being burnt off has to be Ed Sheeran right???
8,1,Winterfell,My new favorite meme is the fact that no one wheeled Bran inside.
8,1,Winterfell,[deleted]
8,1,Winterfell,One question - Where. Is. Ghost?
8,1,Winterfell,[deleted]
8,1,Winterfell,Sam holding in the cry was one of the most painful things I've seen since Hold the Door.
8,1,Winterfell,"Dany: I killed your family

Samwell: You’re fucking your nephew"
8,1,Winterfell,"Prediction:

Theon’s theme is atoning for past sins. He now has his family’s blessing (from Yara) to go fight for the Starks. He’ll arrive in Winterfell in episode 2 and make amends, then die during the battle in episode 3."
8,1,Winterfell,Lord Glover is an ass and a coward
8,1,Winterfell,"Bran: We don’t have time for this.

Daenerys and Jon fly off on their dragons to make out in front of a waterfall."
8,1,Winterfell,"I hate that time and time AGAIN no one listens to Sansa, constantly underestimating her. But she’s really, REALLY showing her smarts now, and I’m so incredibly happy that Arya stood up for her (especially to Jon—which means he’s going to take it seriously.) Maybe Jon will FINALLY start listening to Sansa and be smarter than Ned and Robb like she said he needed to be.

I think Jon will have to pretend to still be in love with Daenerys until they’re finished with the Night King. She’s not shown her bad side to him, but he’ll finally start to see it now.

Overall I’m SO much happier than I thought I would be. So satisfied."
8,1,Winterfell,"Pretty much all of the reunions in the first episode? This was too much happiness right away, I’m worried."
8,1,Winterfell,Game of Thrones always know how to leave an episode on cliffhangers!
8,1,Winterfell,Everyone's talking about Bran and Jaime but can we talk about the moment where Theon decided to go back and fight for the Starks? Such a touching moment after his convo with Jon last season about being a Stark. So happy with this redemption journey
8,1,Winterfell,I'm waiting for an old friend... Bran's a cheeky one.
8,1,Winterfell,[removed]
8,1,Winterfell,Did it take 2 years to come out with the new season because they had to make a new intro?
8,1,Winterfell,Holy mother of all fucking jump scares.
8,1,Winterfell,Not gonna lie.  Screeching Wall Octopus kid made me jump
8,1,Winterfell,"""stay back he's got blue eyes!""
""I've always had blue eyes!""

I live Tormund."
8,1,Winterfell,"Shoutout to John Bradley, dude fucking slayed that scene with Daenerys."
8,1,Winterfell,Bran vs Jamie CONFIRMED
8,1,Winterfell,I want to knit the dragons a sweater.
8,1,Winterfell,"Bran really just sat in the same spot for all night thinking “this is gonna spook him real good,”"
8,1,Winterfell,"Can we take a minute to appreciate how phenomenal the new opening is? Holy shit, it fucking rules from start to finish"
8,1,Winterfell,Let's agree that umber boy screaming was the scariest moment in the fucking series
8,1,Winterfell,Hands down Jaime is the best actor in this show. Literally all he did was make a look in this episode and it told so much
8,1,Winterfell,"With 6 episodes left I'm not surprised if the episode felt a little rushed. Gotta set up the formalities to reintroduce characters to one another.

Edit: I meant 5 episodes left. My bad."
8,1,Winterfell,EVERYONE MET UP AND IM JUST OVER HERE SCREAMING YES EVERY TIME THEY DO
8,1,Winterfell,Eddie the ginger = Ed Sheeran
8,1,Winterfell,All I could hear during the dragon ride was a whole new world
8,1,Winterfell,Wait a minute...couldn't Bran just tell everyone that Cersei lied and she isn't going to help them??
8,1,Winterfell,Was Arya FLIRTING?!
8,1,Winterfell,[deleted]
8,1,Winterfell,"I can’t wait 1 week. I already waited a year whyyyy

Edit: yeah 2 years that makes it even worse >:[

Edit2: yes friends I know. 2 years you can stop telling me <3"
8,1,Winterfell,Dragon budget for season 8 is already used up
8,1,Winterfell,Did that little boy scare the shit out of anyone else?
8,1,Winterfell,0/10 for not being 5 hours long.
8,1,Winterfell,It makes me sad but I'm kind of liking Dany less and less..
8,1,Winterfell,I. Cannot. Wait. For. Brienne. And. Tormund. To. Reunite.
8,1,Winterfell,"That fucking Umber scream scene was well done. I expected him to come back, but that fookin screech scared the fuck out of me."
8,1,Winterfell,"Great start. Sam and Jon’s exchange was so emotional and well done. Love the Bran and Jaime moment at the end. Also, Bronn now hunting Tyrion is kind of badass"
8,1,Winterfell,Lord Glover is a bitch
8,1,Winterfell,"The way the episode was filmed had so many parallels to the very first episode of season one!
1) the army arriving in winter fell
2) excited child watching the army
3) a friendly reunion in the crypts
4) ending with Jamie and Bran

(Might have left some off too)"
8,1,Winterfell,"I love that Jaime tried to kill Bran so he wouldn't reveal his secret, but now Bran knows EVERYONES secrets. Damn that stare was beautiful"
8,1,Winterfell,That weapon blueprint Arya gave to Gendry....it looks like a launchable projectile with dragon glass at the tip.  Have a hunch that Arya is going to kill the Night King’s dragon.
8,1,Winterfell,"Samwell: My dog, Pongo?
Daenerys: Run over by a carriage.
Samwell: My goldfish, Goldie?
Daenerys: Eaten by the cat.
Samwell: My cat?
Daenerys: Choked on the goldfish."
8,1,Winterfell,Lord Umber just became Lord Ember🔥🔥🔥
8,1,Winterfell,"I love how Bran is like ""We don't have time for this."" but he's got no problem sitting in his chair all night waiting for Jaime to show up and Dani and Jon go off to knock boots."
8,1,Winterfell,That dragon flying seen was probably Ghost’s budget for the season.
8,1,Winterfell,Arya and Gendry - the next power couple!
8,1,Winterfell,"Nobody:

Bran: O_O"
8,1,Winterfell,The Three-Eyed Lurker. Somebody should put some bells on that wheelchair.
8,1,Winterfell,The dragon riding “whole new world” scene was far too gratuitous in this short SHORT episode
8,1,Winterfell,"This episode had so many great moments! Moments we've been waiting years to finally see.

Also a lot of comic relief."
8,1,Winterfell,The conversation between Samwell and Daenerys was so AWKWARD!
8,1,Winterfell,Daenerys would 100% not do the same and give up her crown.
8,1,Winterfell,"Rewatching the Night King message scene, the kid's eyes open up partway through and he's staring at them before he starts shrieking. Bruh"
8,1,Winterfell,"Jon: ""I'm not King in the North anymore""
Sam: ""I'm not talking about the King in the North.  I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms."""
8,1,Winterfell,This episode was way too short
8,1,Winterfell,This episode was basically Bran creeping on everyone
8,1,Winterfell,"To continue the circlejerk, Dolorous Edd and Tormund embracing one another was dope. A nightswatchmen and a wildling. Fire AF."
8,1,Winterfell,"Dany and Jon are concerned that the Dragons don't like it up north, so they ride them to a waterfall and.... fuck? Idk good job taking care of them I guess."
8,1,Winterfell,Why isn’t EVERYONE just talking to Bran all the time.  He knows everything about everything.  They should all be bugging the shit out of him not just leaving him in the courtyard to freeze.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Gendry: The Red Woman tied me down and harvested my blood with leeches :/

Arya: wow that's crazy lol so u a virgin?"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Episode 1: Everyone saying hello.

Episode 2: Everyone saying goodbye.



Edit: thank you kind strangers for my first ever silver :)"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Predictions for next week's episode:
- dark
- full of terrors"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,What will happen to the North if they survive when talking to Sansa and realizing Jon/Aegon will have a claim to the Iron Throne. Daenerys can't seem to finish an important conversation without something interrupting her.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Man, you can tell Sansa really meant that hug, he is the ONLY OTHER PERSON TO KNOW WHAT RAMSAY was like."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Find yourself a man who supports your career as much as Tormund supports Brienne's.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,">Might as well be at a bloody wedding

Now we are truly fucked"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Gotta love Jon telling Daenerys right in front of Lyanna

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Oh no, the little girl reminded Davos of Shireen :("
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"O for fucks sake... may as well be at a bloody wedding

The savage Hound"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Why is Tyrion the only one intelligent enough to sit down and interrogate the fuck out of Bran?
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Tyrion: You know...I wish father were here

Jaime: *excuse me what the fuck*"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Dany: ""Lyanna Stark, your aunt?""

Jon: ""Uh... actually funny story about my aunt"""
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,">At least Cersei won't get to murder me

oh no"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,This episode was an hour long reminder of how painful it’s going to be when all our favorite characters inevitably die next week.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Tyrion has a deep conversation with Bran, and then Tyrion later says that he thinks they might survive.  

The future is bright lads"

safe crypts are safter than places that arent crypts

I know a safe place! the crypts!

Hey everyone lets go to down into the crypts that are safe!

these crypts were built to O.S.H.A standards and are safe!

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Okay so like if I stop watching after this episode it's like everyone still alive got their happy ending, right??  😭"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Favorite quote was The Hound. 
“How would your Lord of Light like that you were resurrected 19 times just for me to throw you over this fucking wall” LMAO"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,I wasn’t expecting Jon to tell Dany the news right before the war. I feel like that wasn’t a good idea..
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,When Arya started take her clothes off I was afraid a lot of faces would drop in front of Gendry.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Tyrion to Bran: Let me hear about your adventures north of the wall

Me: hell yeah

arya (throwing sixth knife): reminds me of when i murdered that--

gendry: ok i get it"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Jaime knighting Brienne might be one of the kindest and heartwarming things that has happened in this show, this episode really showed how they have each other's backs.

Theon has been fighting for his redemption for so long and now he's accepted by Sansa as if he was a Stark. Out of all the incredible character arcs in this show, Theon's is exceptionally noteworthy."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne looking at Podrick like a proud mom watching him fight is exactly what I needed. Limiting him to half a cup of wine is full on mom mode. Pod singing made him episode MVP.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Samwell Tarly: Slayer of White Walkers, Lover of Ladies, Stealer of Books. 

My kind of man."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Brienne's smile after getting knighted was the most precious thing in all of Game of Thrones.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,I just want a whole show about the Tyrion-Jaime-Brienne-Tormund-Podrick-Davos circle.

Tormund  - *claps*"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Man, the scene with Podrick singing was fucking incredible. It genuinely feels like every non-plot essential character is going to die. Absolutely haunting and beautiful, the first time this season that I’ve truly felt that this is all about to be over"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"God damn, even the montage friendzoned Jorah. Paired him with a landscape."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,I think so many loose ends are being tied up that none of the characters will have plot armour in the next epic battle... which means anyone can die which is both exciting and please god not Tormund & Brienne
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Tormund: Want to know why they call me Giantsbane?

Jaime: Not if you don’t want an HR complaint."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Tormund’s got his priorities in check haha

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Idk about ya’ll but I’m fucking pumped to see a full-blown Dothraki charge into the army of the dead. 

Edit: Plus potentially some Knights of the Vale? We see some on foot behind Brienne in the teaser for the next episode but we know they have a massive cavalry too."

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,When Grey Worm started talking about the future...*see ya!*
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,I did not expect that Jamie knighting Brienne scene. that was actually wholesome as hell.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Guys, if we thought this episode was emotional and heart wrenching (I’m looking at you, Pod, for really setting the mood)

It’s going to be 10x worse on a future rewatch when we know who dies and that we are watching their last moments 

😭😭😭😭"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"**Podrick Payne has a magic cock, and voice. He's practically unstoppable in the bed room.**

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Game of Thrones episode 69. Cuffing is Coming.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Brienne being knighted was the best part of the story. And awesome that Jaime was the one to do it. It was a great way to possibly cap off her arc.

Unfortunately being knighted like that removed her plot armor, I think. She's done for."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,I choked up when Sansa & Theon saw each other again
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Two Lannisters, a knight, an onion knight, a giantsbane, and Podrick 'fucking swole gentle singer' Payne better make it through this.

I could watch them interact for 60 minutes alone."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Didn't expect Jon to tell Daenerys about him being a Targaryan.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Seriously *no one* in Winterfell foresees an issue with hiding everyone in the crypts from an army that raises the dead?
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Hats off for Jamie apologizing to Bran, really shows how he’s grown as a character."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Dany was legitimately fuming when Jon told her... Ruh roh

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,The Brienne knighting scene has immediately become one of my favorites. Loved the music.

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,The safe crypts are the safest place to be safe in all of super safe Winterfell. Can't wait for everyone there to be safe next week.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"This episode to me felt like a long goodbye. They focused a lot on a few faces, and they took their time exploring that feeling of ""those seconds before everything changes forever"". That scene where Podrick sang was just beautiful. The camera on Dany's face as Jon spoke was beautiful. Brienne being knighted made me cry like a baby.

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,I’m not spending my last night with you old miserable fucks... ima go get Gendry’s hot rod.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Pod singing was so well done. I definitely think it was at least partially an homage to Pippin in Return of the King. The first four notes of both songs are identical - the melody to the lyrics “Home is behind...” and “High in the halls...”.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"The scenes where everyone's around the fire, drinking and essentially bullshitting throughout the night before the battle made me feel things from when I was in the military.

I'm not ready for next week"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Looks like dany is more concerned with jon being the rightful heir than him being her nephew that she fucked lol
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,[deleted]
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Jaime knighting Brienne was so fitting, what a fantastic scene and it made me forgot about the Arya sex scene really quick."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Did Pod and that song remind anyone else of Pippin in LOTR?
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Arya's STD test was the highlight of the episode.

A girl must be safe.

Edit: Thanks for the silver, stranger!"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Did anyone else get a Lord of the Rings feel in this episode? It's down to the survival of men and reminded me of before both battle of Helm's deep and Pelennor Fields. Putting aside previous fighting that men and elves etc had in LotR and houses in GoT. Also Pod's singing reminded me of Pippin and that beautiful/horrible scene when he sings.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"> I'm not a king, but if I were I'd knight you 10 times over.

AWW"

I can’t wait to find out if the Ironborn have any protection against becoming white walkers. Specifically, because they’ve already died and been brought back in their drowning ceremony. 

Secondarily, does this mean Jon would have the same protection?"

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Thank you Tormund for giving me huge belly laughs.

My heart loved Brienne sitting between Tormund and Jaime, even if Jaime isn't actively pursuing her.  That said, dude made her a knight.  Your turn to outdo that, Tormund."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Sansa and Dany going from girl talk and giggles back down to 0 in a second.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Nobody:

Tormund: When I was ten years old I killed a giant then fucked his wife and sucked on her tits.

Everyone: weird flex but ok"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Knowing that Bran's ""haunting stare"" is because the actor can't see without his glasses makes each of his scenes 100% funnier"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"That scene with Sansa and Dany was amaaahhhhzing.  They were both talking about manipulation while clearly trying to manipulate each other, and Sansa made it clear that Jon doesn’t speak for the entire North.   Dany is in way over her head in Westeros."

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Lmao we’re sexual tension the series now. Also it’s pretty much confirmed that Starks like to be on top?
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,GHOST IS ALIVE HOLY SHIT
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"When you think about it though, a teenager's first thought being ""I don't want to die a virgin"" is like the most realistic thing they could have done, if not the most essential. Not saying I needed to see it, but it's definitely in character for someone her age."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Arya: ""When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself""

Sandor: ""I fought for you didnt I?"""
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Best part of ep 2 was Podrick no question. Between the kickassery and the wine and the singing he has become so dope

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"*Tormund used Awkward Story*

It's not very effective...

*Jaime used Knight*

It's super effective!"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"They referenced the crypt as being ""safe"" way too many times. Definitely going to be a blood bath down there."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"So the episode opened with Dany ripping Jaime a new one about killing her father, the fucking mad king who burned alive Rickard and Brandon Stark, whilst sitting in the middle of Winterfell with a bunch of Northmen. And she wonders why they are not fawning all over her. You may have forgotten, Dany, but the North remembers."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,The Onion Knight serving Onion Soup. Fitting.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Fuck the Cleganes, Targaryenbowl might be a thing coming up"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Brienne being knighted by Jaime. Wow. 

Arya. Savage. 

Sansa telling Dany where she stands in terms of the North. The true defender of the North 

Dany telling Sansa she came to the North for John. Bullshit because if you wanna rule you need to defend. 

Theon showing his devotion to Sansa and then Danys reaction. Showing where the division is between ruling and devotion. Dany has no devotion from Westeros.

John telling Dany. Danys acting was perfection. Best she’s done all show. That anger was priceless. That loss. Wow. 

The squad in front of the fire place. That was fucking amazing. Truly. The singing, the chit chat, the honest respect for everyone. 

BRIENNE DEFENDING JAIME. jaimes face of “wow. Cersei would never”. The first time he felt true love and I don’t even know the words. Brienne hit such important points. I’m jaw dropped 

Bran saying the things we do for love. He’s hilarious right now. But he gets it. 

Everything else was fucking amazing too."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Why do I feel Gendry is death marked now? Classic ‘carry on the lineage via unborn child’
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund biggest star of the season!

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Get you a man who supports you like Tormund does Brienne
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"I'm going to be completely honest, out of everything that episode, I still can't get over Pod's luscious flowing hair, and his facial hair stubble. He's straight up stuntin' for the Night King. Long live Pod the Rod™!"

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,[deleted]
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"I really liked the Sansa-Theon scene. Sansa was shown to be very contained from her emotions in a while and I think seeing Theon, after just having talked to Daenerys and not snatching her weave off her face was very emotional for her. Recently she has been dealing with a lot and she doesn’t exactly have a “friend” to vent out. I’m not saying Theon is her friend, but he kind of was when they fled last time. I really think the sight of Theon meant a lot to her. She could talk to him about her feelings and not have to be “strong for him”, but maybe that’s just me"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"This was a lesson in story-telling. 

If you knew you were going to die in a day, what would you want to do? You'd want to drink with your friends. You'd want to make love to the person you've always adored. You'd want to settle scores, and settle differences. 

This was a masterpiece. 

Unfortunately, in the context of there only being six episodes to the remainder of this series, it's going to frustrate a lot of people I thought this was a true delight and just makes me want more."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"That amount of fanservice and build up in one episode... you KNOW shit is going bananas next week.

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,[deleted]
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Really loved this episode. Tons of great moments. Best had to be Tourmond cheering on Brienne after she was Knighted
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Theon+Sansa. She's probably too emotionally/physically scarred to ever have a physical relationship again. And Theon can't, so marry for advantage and have a best friend along the way. Plus, if anyone knows what she went through most, it's him, as Ramsey made him watch. Feel like I haven't seen her that happy since she's returned to Winterfell."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,this episode: the real game of thrones was the friends we made along the way
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"I feel like this episode will divide people. Some will enjoy the talking and catching up. Some will say boring and get to the battle. 

Me personally I loved it and need a whole hour of the fireside chat group."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Dany is not going to accept Jon’s parentage until one of them is at death’s door

Tormund and a Giant's Widow

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Dany doesn't care about sleeping with her nephew. Her first thought is the Iron Throne
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Dany: ""A secret no one in the world knew, except your brother and your best friend, doesn't seem strange to you?""  
Jon: ""Its true Dany. I know it is""  


I wish I could win arguments like that =.="
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Two things:

8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Theory: The thing Arya is running from in the trailer are the previously dead Starks who had been buried in the crypt rising up as wights or white walkers.

That or everyone in the crypt is turned and she has to warn everyone."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"It was cheesy, it was fan service...and it made me happy. Honestly it felt really good to have all these moments after so much and leading up to the end."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,I’m glad Aegon had the balls to tell Daenerys....
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,The best part of it was when Dany realize everyone listens to John and He has the true blood of king. The end was very good and thrilling. I think we’ll see one of our beloved characters become whitewalker.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Danny’s reaction to Jon’s lineage is 100% about the iron throne and 0% about how she’s been doing her nephew.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,A girl has no virginity
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Brienne’s definitely dead, her story arc is complete."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Tyrion: ""Sir Brienne of Tarth: defeated the Hound. Pardon me, *Lady* Brienne.""

Tormund: ""She's not a Sir? You'not a Knight?""

Brienne: ""Women can't be knights.""

Tormund: ""Why not?""

Brienne: ""Tradition.""

Tormund: ""***Fuck*** tradition!""

Brienne: ""I didn't want to be a knight...""

Tormund: ""I am no king. But if I were, **I'd knight you ten times over**."""
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Jon gets deadlocked with NK, Dany has to decide to burn them both - Jon walks out unburnt, confirms his claim to Dany"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Tormund was fantastic this episode, my favorite line of his - ""they called me Giantsbane, do you want to know why?"""
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund clapping almost made me cry it was so sweet
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"I hated Sansa at the beginning of the show, and she has definitely matured. She is right, men do stupid things when they are in love. I believe Jon will be able to stay level headed to know the end goal, take down the Night King"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"It’s a cool note that the sword Brienne is wearing and the sword Jaime knights her with are both Valyrian steel swords forged from Ned Stark’s Ice , and the knighting takes place in Ned’s home."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Dany gets this Gollum “my precious” look in her eye every time her claim to the Iron Throne is remotely threatened
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Is there anything Pod can't do?
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,I was not expecting the nudity to be Arya.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"A few takeaways.

1. Of all the possibilities I have imagined about this show I can confidently say seeing Arya's side boob wasn't one of them!
2. I really wish there could be a 3 hour online episode of Tyrion and Bran talking. I can only imagine the questions Tyrion had!
3. I don't like Dany's tone as of late, she better get her shit together
4. I don't think I have ever been so hyped for a new episode. I am fucking pumped for next week!

Edit: Forgot to mention Sansa’s armor clothing. She really did learn a thing or two from Cersei!"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Tormund and Sandor are the heroes we deserve, and need!"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Just realized that between next weeks episode and endgame I am not going to be in an emotionally healthy place
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Oh man, the entire gang around the fire. Those were the best sequences tonight."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"That scene of Ser Jorah standing alone after we got the shots of the characters who found love was absolutely beautifully done...the writing behind ser jorah from his first appearance is such an underrated story arc in the show and that shot nailed it.

He had everything, a powerful house who all other houses respected, a wife and family and he lost it all due to his demons..but he chose to fight and redeem himself because he fights not just for love but for the vision of a better world..."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"What. A. Fucking. Episode.

It had Ghost, it had Arya & Gendry, it had Brienne & Jaime, it had Jon & Daenerys, it had everything I coud've asked for a pre-fight episode."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"tormunds appreciation of brienne is so pure. his applause made me happy.

arya in her afterglow was so unimpressed! i guess gendry is no podrick...

sansa may be in love with theon and they hurt my heart.

dany.. man, dany.. she did not react well. she stepped away from him quick.

i loved this ep! it was great to have a chance to enjoy the characters, and their interactions, before everything goes to shit. 

got has always been a show of conversation, not action back to back. i don't understand those who were bored. do you not 

love the characters and their relationships?"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,[deleted]
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Never thought I would be this anti Daenerys, but here I am."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Time to prepare my Greyjoy loving self for Theon to sacrifice himself for Bran :(
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Sansa made my life in this episode. For a second there I was like goddamnit I don’t want her to just give into Dany easily, but then my girl pulled the fuck up!"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,It'll get hatred but that was the best episode in a long time. Exactly the pacing we've been missing for 2 seasons. Tension perfectly poised. Well done.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Tormund: You know this could be the last night of our lives.

Brienne: You're right, there's only one thing to do on a night like this.

Tormund: Aw yeah...

Brienne: Time to become the first female knight in the Seven Kingdoms."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Looks like a certain Night King was missing with a certain ice dragon from a certain last shot. I wonder where he is?

&#x200B;

Perhaps Kings Landing?"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Pod is the Pippin of Game of Thrones
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,IMAGINING ARYA HAVING SEX FEELS SO WRONG OMG
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Which way do y'all want it?  People complained last season that the episodes moved too quickly, and people now complain that they're too slow.

I liked the impending doom vibe this episode; reminds me of the Two Towers before the battle starts."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Everyone: We chose to come here for the greater good.


Bran: ya fools, you are nothing but pawns in this game all about me"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,SER👏BRIENNE👏OF👏TARTH
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Tormund is a national treasure that only wanted to suckle on another Giant's teet.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,That frame of Brienne smiling was the most happy i've ever been for a charachter in GoT.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"You’ve heard of the Red Wedding folks, but are you ready for...



...A Wight Wedding?!"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, In this episode: Dany learns she is assistant to the regional manager﻿
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,All of those scenes around the fireplace has got to be some of the best television I've ever seen. Podrick's little chuckle as Tyrion filled his cup all the way full had me in stitches!
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Jon - hey Dany we are minutes from likely death here’s a mind blowing bombshell
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Arya and The Hound 100% survive. Arya's got to meet Melisandre again, and of course CleganeBowl or we riot!"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,with the end of episode 2 begins the longest week in GoT history
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Things we've learned: Bran tells Jaime he'll not survive the war, Arya received two spears from Gendry, Pod can sing, Dany finds out she has a brand new nephew"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Anyone calling this a ""filler"" episode has never seen an actual filler episode. A filler episode is a completely separate plot that has nothing to do with the primary plot at all and is typically completely forgotten and doesn't affect the characters at all. This was definitely not that."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Pod probably sang to those prostitutes in King's Landing tbh.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Noticed the night king was nowhere to be found. Maybe the theories are true.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Oh, Dany. Isn't it convenient to believe Bran about everything else but deny that you are not, in fact, the true heir to the iron throne?"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Wow a decent amount to unpack here. First of all and most important, a big reveal and answer that we've been waiting for. Bran is ""the memory"" of this world and the Night King is trying to kill him to erase this world and have a ""long night"" which presumably means the dead rule without the living. I think this pretty much ends the theory that Bran is the Night King but that could still possibly come true. 

This episode evoked a lot of emotions. The scene where Jamie knights Ser Brienne was pretty powerful. Arya and Gendry was a fun scene. Dany reacting to Jon telling who her he is was...interesting. Everyone's overall demeanor regarding the dead being basically right around the corner is unsettling. 

A few more reunions this episode. Theon returning to Winterfell/Sansa. Jamie meeting Dany was interesting to think of the dynamic of them two (which btw, Jamie hasn't aged nearly as much throughout the story as he probably should have based on the timeline). 

The dialogue was a lot better this episode than last. A lot of the conversation seemed more natural and well written. It advanced the overall plot and left a major cliffhanger for what is shaping up to be an awesome episode next episode. 

I'll add onto this if I think of more but overall I was very happy with this episode.

Edit: Tormund's scene was hilarious. Dany and Sansa's conversation was interesting and unfortunate that it was cut short.

Edit 2: I think Jamie has become my favorite character. I think his arc has had the most depth to it when you consider what he's been through throughout his story."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Pod’s song and the scenes shown were some of the most emotional of the series.

I’m crying.


We’re all going to cry a lot next week guys.  GoT has perfected emotional gut punches."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,When  Tormund eventually bags Brienne I’d love to see the look on his face when he realizes he’s gonna have to raise her son Podrick
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Three Horn Blasts.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,If there’s one takeaway here it’s that the crypts are definitely SUPER safe and anyone down there is definitely going to be fine.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Episode 69 may have had some 69. Nice Game of Thrones. Real nice.

Arya not going out a virgin."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Jon before the start of the big battle.

""Oh btw we're related lol how awks is that."""
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"#My name... my real name, is Aegon Targaryen.

Jon with the absolute best worst timing ever."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Writers: ""Hey loyal watchers, you know that sex scene you've been waiting for?  ... this isn't it."""
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Podrick is definitely invited to the cookout
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Jon: *Looking solemnly at Lyanna's statue*

Dany: Now seems like a great time to tell you about how my brother raped her"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Can we all just take a moment to realize how quickly shit just fell apart for Daenerys? Everyone just straight up ignored her and put their trust in Jamie, the man who killed her father. Sansa told her the North will never serve under her or anyone else again. And to top it all off, Jon just dropped the biggest shitstorm on her moments before battle. She went from top of the world to shit in two episodes."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"In the name of the warrior,
I charge you to be brave.
In the name of the father,
I charge you to be just.
In the name of the mother,
I charge you to defend the innocent.
Arise, Brienne of tarth,
A knight of the seven kingdoms!"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"My theory:

Everyone dies next episode.  Night King wins and kills everyone in Winterfell.  Takes his 3 undead dragons and murders Cersei, then burns the Iron Fleet and everyone else.  Sits down to enjoy his new world like Thanos in Infinity War.  Bran can be seen in the background staring creepily and making a reference to the Night King's past.

The last 3 episodes are just 80+ minutes each of George R. R. Martin maniacally laughing into the camera while burning drafts of the next book."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,That was like watching your daughter have sex
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"At least Ghost showed up, probably means he'll die next episode..."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,No one's talking about Gilly being pregnant?
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Man I was just thinking, the Dothraki are some loyal motherfuckers to Dany. Can't tell me there isn't a one of them going..""How is this our fight? I'm going back home now"""
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"During the scene where Arya throws the dragonglass blades and Gendry looks amazed: YES!!!

During Arya and the Hound Scene: Go find Gendry for end of the world sex!!!

During the sex scene: NO, Oh god no. I changed my mind."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Sansa and Theon

The reunion I never knew I wanted to see"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,How is Ghost just there???
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,Nobody drank any water before that battle and gendy busted a nut. Lol wtf everyone prepped so poorly
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Didn't realize how much I didnt want to see an Arya sex scene.

What a beautiful episode though. Only 4 more you guys."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,All these ships they setting up can only mean that half of them will die.
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Wasn’t it strange that no one mentioned the dead have their own dragon when they were planning strategy at the table?
Seems like an important fact...."
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"Okay so I think the NK’s Robb Stark inspired tactics are now all-but-confirmed. The Battle for Winterfell is a red herring. He sends his massive (dispensable) army through the North to meet humanity’s last stand. Meanwhile, he flies Viserion south to King’s Landing and its population of one million ‘wight-to-be’s. A brand new army, larger in size and within marching distance of the NK’s true target. Not Bran, but what Bran represents. Memory. The memory of the children of the forest. The last vestige of their magic that brought about his eternal living death. The heart of the weirwood network. The Isle of Faces. That’s what Ned Umber burning at the centre of a spiral representing. Igniting the heart and watching the fire spread across the branches and destroy the whole network... But what then?"
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,[deleted]
8,2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,"The two most important things Jon could've said were ""I just found out"" and ""I don't want the throne"". He conveyed this information the worst way possible. He really Jon'd this one up."

8,3,The Long Night,"If Jon is good at anything, it's usig his calvary ineffectively as possible."
8,3,The Long Night,who did bran warg the entire ep? besides those birds
8,3,The Long Night,Pretty sure Sam died like 12 times tonight.
8,3,The Long Night,"Welcome to Winterfell.

Population: 11, maybe 12"
8,3,The Long Night,Someone tell Sansa there will be no issue feeding everyone at Winterfell now
8,3,The Long Night,"bran's ""i'm going now"" is such a power move. i wish i could duck out of social situations like that."
8,3,The Long Night,Are you telling me Grey Worm actually survived?? AND Brienne??
8,3,The Long Night,That initial wights charge was the scariest fucking thing. They weren't even walking just flowing like a tsunami.
8,3,The Long Night,"Giants: 2

Winterfell gate: 0"
8,3,The Long Night,You know Sansa was feelin awkward sittin with her ex husband watching everyone be devoured by her dead relatives
8,3,The Long Night,Jon seeing Sam getting attacked by a shit ton of wights and still leaving damn that must've been tough
8,3,The Long Night,"Bran: ""Yo Theon get redemption and sacrifice yourself for me I'm gonna just chill here and play raven flight simulator 2000. Gotta go."""
8,3,The Long Night,Lmao samwell tarly just stabbing left and right while laying in a pile of bodies
8,3,The Long Night,Did anyone else find that literal tidal wave of undead at the start absolutely disturbing?
8,3,The Long Night,Jorah is the ultimate tank.
8,3,The Long Night,[deleted]
8,3,The Long Night,Melisandre pulling an Obi Wan over here
8,3,The Long Night,"Melisandre: ""I will be dead before the dawn.""

Major flex, dying legit in front of the dawn."
8,3,The Long Night,"Melisandre. 3rd person to die of old age. Silent killer that one is.

Edit: Forgot about dear Hoster Tully. That makes 3. Who knows maybe Tyrion will live to 80 and make it 4"
8,3,The Long Night,"So Bran, What is it ya say you do around here?"
8,3,The Long Night,That moment Brienne and Jaime were defending Stark walls with Stark steel.
8,3,The Long Night,Can’t believe the Winterfell Crypts were made out of drywall.
8,3,The Long Night,Can we pour one out for our boy Edd? Died a virgin :(
8,3,The Long Night,Slowest walk of my life.
8,3,The Long Night,"Best part for me was when Sandor was giving up all hope and then saw Arya struggling with the zombies, then ran to her aid because it's PAPA BEAR TIME"
8,3,The Long Night,Beric Dondarian totally pulled off the best Hodor impression we've seen since the original
8,3,The Long Night,"The very beginning when the Dothraki were charging and then suddenly hit a wall of darkness out of nowhere, and all their lights went out... that set the mood real fast"
8,3,The Long Night,"When the light from the Dothraki's swords went out... 

""They're fucked."""
8,3,The Long Night,"Dracarys.

[""Nice try.""](https://i.imgur.com/FmIbYOY.png)"
8,3,The Long Night,The Lord of Light definitely didn’t have a hand in the cinematography
8,3,The Long Night,I count two dragons!! I COUNTED TWO DRAGONS!!!
8,3,The Long Night,"Confirmed death count: 

* Edd 
* Beric Dondarrion 
* Lyanna Mormont 
* Theon Greyjoy
* Jorah Mormont 
* Night King 
* Melisandre 

Confirmed living: 

* Ghost 
* Drogon 
* Rhaegal"
8,3,The Long Night,Jon straight up yelled at a fucking dragon lmao
8,3,The Long Night,Did Jon see Sam dying and just keep it moving?
8,3,The Long Night,Was hoping to get some dialogue between the NK and Bran.
8,3,The Long Night,so um... what do we do now?
8,3,The Long Night,"i think it'd be easier if bran just held up a sign that said: ""i forgive you for all the shit you did to me"""
8,3,The Long Night,"bran: im going to go now

[bran wargs into a raven that immediately gets toasted by dragonfire]

bran: im back. that sucked"
8,3,The Long Night,"House Mormont should change their motto to ""You're welcome"""
8,3,The Long Night,9000 years and NK takes an L first fight past the wall lmao
8,3,The Long Night,My boy Ghost gone for 3 years only to come back and lead the charge.
8,3,The Long Night,Soooo are all of the Dothraki wiped out of existence?!
8,3,The Long Night,Let's fucking pour one out for House Mormont
8,3,The Long Night,"So who’s job is it to clean up dead bodies?

Also, what kind of fuckery is going to happen in the battle in episode 5? The good guys literally have no army, all that’s left are the main characters"
8,3,The Long Night,So Beric’s purpose is to save Arya so she can continue with the final kill. Melisandres purose is to give her the final reminder ‘not today’ to give her the push. Crazy that it’s the people on her list there to save her so she can seal the deal.
8,3,The Long Night,UPDATE THE CRYPTS ARE NOT SAFE
8,3,The Long Night,**HOUSE MORMONT HAS BEEN ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFF CONTENTION**
8,3,The Long Night,RIP Night King goes to Kings Landing theory April 2019 - April 2019
8,3,The Long Night,"Script for this episode:

58 minutes : AAGAHHAHHHAGHHAHHHHHAGHHRHHHHH"
8,3,The Long Night,"Theon-""I just want you to know, I wish...The things I did...""

Bran-""Everything you did brought you where you are now. Where you belong. Home""

We saw the lowkey reunion between Theon and Bran last week, I'm glad we got a proper conversation between this two."
8,3,The Long Night,"Ironic that Danny, in her time of greatest need, was protected by the ancestral sword of House Tarly, given the fact she burned Lord Tarly and his heir."
8,3,The Long Night,So Beric was kept alive this entire time to save Arya so that she could kill the Night King?!
8,3,The Long Night,Shoutout to all my Dothraki boys.
8,3,The Long Night,[removed]
8,3,The Long Night,"Now we get to see Cersei and her army against Jon, Dany and their 25 remaining soldiers."
8,3,The Long Night,Who else was thinking their TV is shit?
8,3,The Long Night,my favorite character was Jorah. he went strong for 8 seasons. proud of my boy. died the way he wanted - protecting the love of his life. *sniff*
8,3,The Long Night,"WILDCARD, BITCHES"
8,3,The Long Night,"Shoutout to Theon, he could've called in a nuke with his killstreak"
8,3,The Long Night,"Jon: We did it. We beat the dead.

Bran: We don’t have time for any of this. Cersei has 4 elephants."
8,3,The Long Night,I secretly wanted NK to kneel before Bran.
8,3,The Long Night,That was the haziest battle I’ve ever partially seen.
8,3,The Long Night,"All of house Mormont dead.

Fuck"
8,3,The Long Night,"Knowing Game of Thrones I was not expecting this many ""main characters"" to survive."
8,3,The Long Night,I think the most important takeaway from this episode is that Cleganebowl is still on the menu
8,3,The Long Night,"Jaqen H'ghar:  A girl owes many deaths to the Many Faced God.

Arya:  A girl has repaid."
8,3,The Long Night,The Night King blew a million-to-one lead.
8,3,The Long Night,Baeric and Melissandre's only goal was to save Arya. The Lord of light kept them around for that exact moment.
8,3,The Long Night,"Arya: Yo Bran did you see that, i killed them all!

&#x200B;

Bran:"
8,3,The Long Night,"Who the fuck thought to put them in the crypt without at least a couple guards? The enemy can literally bring back the fucking dead, did no one else consider what happened in the crypts as even a remote possibility?"
8,3,The Long Night,The scene with the fire going out with all the Dothraki was fucking BOSS
8,3,The Long Night,Rogue OP
8,3,The Long Night,For a second there I was so sure bran would stand up and turn out to be Arya
8,3,The Long Night,what was the point of NK's bodyguard anyways. They didn't do shit the whole season
8,3,The Long Night,THAT STILL ONLY COUNTS AS ONE
8,3,The Long Night,that is why switch hitters are important
8,3,The Long Night,"“I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight.” - Lyanna Mormont

RIP, sweet little zombie angel."
8,3,The Long Night,I actually teared up when Sandor has just given up and then he looks at Arya in trouble and immediately snaps out of it and runs to help her 😭
8,3,The Long Night,"**WINTERFELL used DOTHRAKI!**

*It's not very effective.*"
8,3,The Long Night,Stick them with the pointy end!
8,3,The Long Night,Waaaaay fewer major character deaths than I was afraid of
8,3,The Long Night,Well No One killed the Night King
8,3,The Long Night,"Bury Theon in the crypts of Winterfell, he deserves it."
8,3,The Long Night,"Lyanna Mormont: Lady of Bear Island, Frost-Zombie-Giant Slayer.

Here We Stand."

8,3,The Long Night,SO THAT'S WHY BRAN GAVE ARYA THE DAGGER
8,3,The Long Night,"Sandor: ""We're fighting death. We can't defeat death.""

Arya: ""Lol k"""
8,3,The Long Night,The scene with the Dothraki's flaming weapons slowly disappearing in the dark was the most terrifying scene that I have ever seen on this show.
8,3,The Long Night, Bran - brb lol gonna go get some third person footage of our asses getting kicked
8,3,The Long Night,this episode was a real life example of what playing nazi zombies at the highest levels felt like
8,3,The Long Night,Who else thought Sansa and Tyrion were going to kill them selves when they each pulled out their daggers and sad music started playing
8,3,The Long Night,"Best part was the slow piano montage of everyone dramatically fighting to the last breath with a shot in the middle of Sam lying on the ground, sobbing uncontrollably."
8,3,The Long Night,I'm spent.
8,3,The Long Night,Did Jon's dragon make it?
8,3,The Long Night,"So... how the fuck are they going to top that? The main villain, death incarnate, is defeated. Fighting Cersei will feel like going back to finish side missions after completing the main story."
8,3,The Long Night,"Me: NOT LYANNA DON’T LET HER BE DEAD

Me: That’s not what I meant"
8,3,The Long Night,"jon really just tried to 1v1 a dragon

edit: it was never the case that targaryens are immune to fire. it was a dany-only thing."
8,3,The Long Night,"They planned this battle as well as I play Star Craft: A-click my strong units forward, see that didn't work and totally lose my head, try to turtle until I inevitably lose, but get lucky and have my opponent DC just before he finishes me off."
8,3,The Long Night,THAT ENTIRE LIBRARY SCENE WAS JUST THE KITCHEN SCENE WITH THE RAPTORS FROM JURASSIC PARK AND I LOVED IT
8,3,The Long Night,"Go to the crypts they said, it will be safe they said"
8,3,The Long Night,I love how “the dead Starks will fight for the living” was such a popular theory and then they just massacred the entire crypts group
8,3,The Long Night,"jon: they’ll all go down if we kill the Night—

dothraki: kill the night? you got it boss (they all charge the darkness)

jon: …King"
8,3,The Long Night,Ramin Djawadi ist the real MVP of this episode. Holy shit. Never got so close to a panic attack because of music. Just brilliant.
8,3,The Long Night,This episode: The night so dark I can't see the terrors
8,3,The Long Night,The dagger that started it... ended it.
8,3,The Long Night,Im kinda mad the night king bitched out on the 1v1 with Jon
8,3,The Long Night,[removed]
8,3,The Long Night,Jorah’s final moment was just looking at the woman he loved. I can’t... my heart.
8,3,The Long Night,"At least my hopes for Clegangebowl survived this episode, unlike everything else. What an episode."
8,3,The Long Night,Low-key thought Tyrion and Sansa about to double sucide
8,3,The Long Night,"The waif died for this. “The King won’t give you any honors, the histories won’t mention you, but we will not forget.”"
8,3,The Long Night,"First episode this season. Jon at the Godswood. Arya appears. 

“how did you sneak up on me”


;)

Edit: thanks for my first ever reddit gold(s) strangers!"
8,3,The Long Night,[removed]
8,3,The Long Night,"Everyone: ""Okay everyone let's keep a tight formation and keep the dead scattered and running into our traps while we mitigate their forces using trebuchets and dragon fire""

Dothraki: Alright chums, (I’m back)! Let’s do this… LEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEEEENKIIIIIIIIIIINS! [runs into certain death]"
8,3,The Long Night,What was Bran DOING the entire time?! I thought the entire time he would try and do something useful with his powers. Instead he literally did nothing!
8,3,The Long Night,[deleted]
8,3,The Long Night,All that work and re-animating by the Night King to get fucked at the finish line. We should refer to him as the Canadian Oberyn Martell.
8,3,The Long Night,I don't know why I'm scrolling through these comments as if one of them is going to answer all of my questions about the White Walkers.
8,3,The Long Night,Melisandre the real mvp making it so we could actually see what the fuck is going on this episode.
8,3,The Long Night,THE NIGHT KING HAS BEEN ELIMINATED FROM CHAMPIONSHIP CONTENTION
8,3,The Long Night,"Theon knew he would die but chose chose to run at death rather than running away, which was his redemption. Nothing short of dying for someone would redeem him. He is a good man."
8,3,The Long Night,My therapist will hear about this episode.
8,3,The Long Night,Bran: I'm going to go now  - *Cue Windows XP Shutdown Tune*
8,3,The Long Night,"Jon and Dany would love league, they never group for team fights"
8,3,The Long Night,Can I just say that the music for this episode was fucking on point
8,3,The Long Night,"I didn’t think that Ramin could top Light of the Seven, but holy fuck that song was incredible. The man’s a god damn genius.

EDIT: I’m talking about the song that played during the end sequence of the episode when the NK was closing in on Bran. I don’t know if I think it’s better than LotS, but it was definitely an amazing piece of music."
8,3,The Long Night,"Jon: 1v1 me!

Night King: Nah \**aoe reraise*\*

Jon: For fuck's sake!"
8,3,The Long Night,Winterfell is going to be extremely haunted moving forward
8,3,The Long Night,[removed]
8,3,The Long Night,"Yo when arya pulled that fucking clutch i heard like 9 kids on my dorm floor start fucking screaming. (Including me)

Edit: Thanks for the gild on my comment kind stranger"
8,3,The Long Night,I can't believe they actually made Cersei the final boss
8,3,The Long Night,"NightKingSmirk.gif

EDIT: [10 minutes later](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5SX1xGWAAI5ukK?format=jpg&name=large)

Sure Bran could have planned it so Arya would have been posted there with the knife from the beginning but they wanted to [Jordan switch hand](https://youtu.be/Zo-1XNRP-00) his ass at the last minute. David Tyree with the helmet catch"
8,3,The Long Night,the night king is basically ice imhotep
8,3,The Long Night,Arry killed Coldemort
8,3,The Long Night,">## BROWN EYES,GREEN EYES **AND BLUE EYES**.    

ARYA MVP"
8,3,The Long Night,Tyrion and Sansa going to get married again confirmed!
8,3,The Long Night,"Really enjoyed the way they filmed the Dothraki charge scene, it was a great way to combine the narrative device of Melisandre buffing the Dothraki army's weapons(badass af)and the following destruction of said army.  The individual fires on the Dothraki weapons thinning out to illustrate how quickly and easily they were obliterated by the night king army was super terrifying and oddly beautiful.  Great episode."
8,3,The Long Night,Apparently weddings can kill more characters than the army of the dead
8,3,The Long Night,My sisters fit bit thought she was working out during this episode.
8,3,The Long Night,Arya playing cat and mouse with the wights in the library was so intense.
8,3,The Long Night,"**Didn't know Lyanna Mormont was in Attack on Titan, fuck. What a way to go out.**"
8,3,The Long Night,"Bran fucking knew, he gave her the dagger"
8,3,The Long Night,at least you could tell when brienne was on screen because she can't open a package of pop-tarts without screaming at an operatic high c
8,3,The Long Night,I just realized the dagger that started this whole series is the one that killed the night king.
8,3,The Long Night,The Dothraki lasted as long as I do in bed
8,3,The Long Night,Holy fuck I can’t process what I just saw
8,3,The Long Night,"Motherfucking blue eyes, goddamn that fucking foreshadowing from season 3.

EDIT:

I'm referring to Season 3 episode 6 where Melisandre says this to Arya. ""I see a darkness in you,” she says. “And in that darkness, eyes starring back at me. Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you’ll shut forever. We will meet again.”"
8,3,The Long Night,"Let's give thanks to the true MVP - Syrio Forel, with a co-MVP title to Jaqen H'ghar

If Syrio doesn't teach Arya to say ""Not today"" to the God of Death in season 1, the Night King wins.

If Jaqen doesn't train Arya to survive and train to fight at a disadvantage, the Night King wins.

Also, we can just say that Braavos is the best place ever in this world. Home to the Iron Bank so it holds all the pursestrings, home to the Faceless Men, a bunch of shadowy assassins, so it has the badass silent killer factor that manipulates the world."
8,3,The Long Night,[deleted]
8,3,The Long Night,IM IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION
8,3,The Long Night,Holy shit that Arya stealth sequence was ROUGH!
8,3,The Long Night,Winterfell is where winter fell. Wow.
8,3,The Long Night,Lyanna Mormont and Arya with the clutches. The two little girls turned out to deliver the most unexpected blows.
8,3,The Long Night,"Blue eyes... eyes you will shut forever.

What do we say to the god of death? Not today.

Her whole story was building up to this moment and it blindsighted most of us."
8,3,The Long Night,"All of the Dothraki's fires going out in the distance only to leave darkness was so well done, honestly horrifying."
8,3,The Long Night,"What was Bran doing? What were you doing Bran? 

This show has no flashbacks. 
Bran does not speak. 

We will never know. 

Truly the most agonizing part of today’s episode. 


What did you do, Bran???"
8,3,The Long Night,"""Stick them with the pointy end""

""Theon, you are a good man. Thank you""

In an episode filled so much sadness, those two statements brought all the smiles to my face."
8,3,The Long Night,That was the most difficult/stressful episode of a TV show I've ever watched
8,3,The Long Night,I though Sansa and Tyrion were going to kill themselves in a Romeo and Juliet esc fashion. To me it seemed thats what the dagger was for.
8,3,The Long Night,[deleted]
8,3,The Long Night,Night King kinda cute ngl
8,3,The Long Night,"The Night King is the '07 Patriots. Far and away better than everyone else, but the scrappy team caught 'em on an off day."
8,3,The Long Night,[deleted]
8,3,The Long Night,Beric coming back 17 times to save Arya so she could kill The Night King
8,3,The Long Night,Lyanna 'Giantsbane' Mormont. Killed a giant at the age of thirteen in the Battle of Winterfell. Her greatest and final act. And now her watch has ended.
8,3,The Long Night,"The White walkers arc just ended??? like that??? I didn’t see that coming

Edit : don't get me wrong it was an amazing episode and most importantly battle but I thought that we would see the WW march south but it ended in a way where the other main villain (if you call Cersei that) didn't even get to fight them? 

And let's be honest if ithey would have walked south we wouldnt have had a problem with the luminosity there"
8,3,The Long Night,"Can we build a list of who is still alive?

Alive:

- Bran
- Arya
- Jon
- Dany
- The Hound
- Sansa
- Tyrion
- Missandei
- Varys
- Gilly
- Jaime
- Brienne
- Podrick
- Rhaegal and Drogon
- Davos
- Grey Worm 
- Ghost
- Gendry
- Sam
- Tormund


Definitely Dead:

- Theon
- Jorah Mormont
- Lyanna Giantsbane Mormont
- Beric Donderian
- Pretty much all the Unsullied
- Dothraki Horde
- Melisandre
- Edd
- Night King
- Viserion"
8,3,The Long Night,"HOLY FUCKING SHIT, ARYA!!! 

I certainly enjoyed watching silhouettes go at it for 80 minutes!

Theon was a fucking badass, though. I think he had one of the best story arcs ever.

Also, the score produced by Ramin Djawadi for this episode was everything I thought it would be and more."
8,3,The Long Night,"HOLYSHIT...... I CAN'T TAKE THESE PANIC ATTACKS

Edit: WHAT IS DEAD MAY NEVER DIE."
8,3,The Long Night,There went the CGI budget
8,3,The Long Night,"""I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me. Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes... eyes you'll shut forever""-Melisandre 3x06

Brown Eyes-Walder/Littlefinger?

Blue Eyes-Night King

Green Eyes-Cersei?

It is known...

edit: Do you guys think they planned this shit since season 3?"
8,3,The Long Night,"You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive.

edit: a man is thankful for the gift (of gold)"
8,3,The Long Night,"R.I.P. to Beric Dondarrion, may the Lord of Light smile upon your great sacrifice."
8,3,The Long Night,Arya gave'em the old Razzle Dazzle.
8,3,The Long Night,Arya with the knife hand switch just like against Brienne. Chills.
8,3,The Long Night,That NK smirk was SO GOOD
8,3,The Long Night,“Not today” - Arya Fucking Stark
8,3,The Long Night,Cleganebowl still on then

8,3,The Long Night,"Arya doesn't serve the God of Death. She is the God of Death, because HOLY FUCK"
8,3,The Long Night,"#THEON NOOOOOOOO

This guy was so conflicted all his life. Stark kids didn't treat him as his own, his own dad thinks he's more of a stark now. Betrayed Robb like the bitch he is, was tortured by Ramsay, went through a name change. Guy redeemed himself

Edit: the brightness of this episode was way too low, it took away from the atmosphere since I had to be 2 inches away from my screen to see anything"
8,3,The Long Night,Arya called game off the backboard
8,3,The Long Night,[deleted]
8,3,The Long Night,"""Theon you're a good man. Now go commit die.""

Edit: Thank you kindest stranger for my first gold.

Edit 2: 2nd Gold??!!! Not as exciting as the first one. I kid. Thank you kind stranger. I love you."
8,3,The Long Night,[removed]
8,3,The Long Night,Mixed feelings but holy shit that score
8,3,The Long Night,"""You are a good man Theon"" legit made me cry. When you think about it this has been Theon's whole struggle post-Reek. He has never felt like he was a good person or a man."
8,3,The Long Night,Little Bear took out a giant wight as was being crushed. A fucking hero. And now her watch is ended.
8,3,The Long Night,After Arya kills the night king. Gimli is off in the distance shouting “THATS STILL ONLY COUNTS AS ONE!”
8,3,The Long Night,CLEGANBOWL IS STILL ON!!🎉🎉🎉
8,3,The Long Night,"Honestly I feel like the Night King should’ve won this battle. He’s been hyped for 7 seasons, they can’t just end his arc on Winterfell."
8,3,The Long Night,Arya you fucking badass.
8,3,The Long Night,[deleted]
8,3,The Long Night,[deleted]
8,3,The Long Night,"She will close brown, green, and BLUE EYES HOLY SHIT!"
8,3,The Long Night,Back in the episode when John was next to the tree and Arya sneaks up on him and he asked “how did you sneak up on me”. In the exact same spot she snuck up on the Night King. AMAZING
8,3,The Long Night,"Lyanna ""Giantsbane"" Mormont"
8,3,The Long Night,The Night King only dare set foot in Winterfell after Lyanna Mormont died
8,3,The Long Night,"About 55 mins in 
* night king resurrected all his soldiers 
Me: WHAT A SORE FUCKING LOSER"
8,3,The Long Night,I can't be the only one who wanted Bran to take control of the Blue Eyes White Dragon?
8,3,The Long Night,*House Mormont has left the chat.*
8,3,The Long Night,i didnt know game of thrones was gonna be the dopest zombie movie of all time
8,3,The Long Night,Honestly thought Bran was gonna take off his mask and reveal that he was in fact Arya
8,3,The Long Night,"When Melisandre was lighting the moat and her voice faltered after a few failed attempts, anxiety inducing shit right there."
8,3,The Long Night,Am I the only one that thought that giant would legit eat  lyanna mormont?
8,3,The Long Night,"*looks over at Sam stabbing a bed of bodies*

Jon: ""eh Sam's alright"""
8,3,The Long Night,Am I the only person that didn’t have an issue with how dark this episode was? I feel like it was purposeful and really added to the tension because you were constantly thinking one of your favorite characters were being slain...
8,3,The Long Night,"Today, Theon's cock and balls were bigger than ever."
8,3,The Long Night,"TONIGHT’S GAME OF THRONES EPISODE: “ITS FUCKING DARK”

Edit: Holy fuck silver 
I know I have a little bit of time so I'm gonna rush and say everybody, and you cut away, I won't be mad at you. Bran said don't forget to thank Jorah.  I will never forget to thank my high school sweetheart and the mother of my children, Cersei. I love you, Theon.  And my parents who are here, Robert and Joanna. And... Night King, I love you. Hallelujah. Thank you, Father God, for putting me through what you put me through, but I'm here and I'm happy. I just want to... [Music begins to play]. Oh, here we go... Okay, the studio, I love you. And Jon Snow  and... Arya! I love you, Sister! I love you, Girl! [Applause starts.] The Hound, Tormund, Beric, all my night watch crew. Tyrion, I love you! You did a great job when we made the movie! Everybody involved with the movie! [Loud cheering begins.] I love you! Oh my goodness! Here we are! I love you but keep going.

Holy smokes. Terrifying."

Me: who the hell has blue eyes in this series?

10 minutes later

Me: OMG"
8,3,The Long Night,Night King is a glass cannon.
8,3,The Long Night,Pussy Night King wanted no part of a 1 v. 1 with Jon. Raised his zombie horde instead. Like a bitch!
8,3,The Long Night,Never in my life would I have expected Arya to be the one that saves humanity
8,3,The Long Night,ARYA = AZOR AHAI
8,3,The Long Night,No other show in the history of television could have an hour and a half long episode with almost zero dialog and keep me on the edge of my seat like that.
8,3,The Long Night,Why did they send the Dothraki out by themselves? That is literally one of the dumbest things I have seen. Why did Jon and Dany not use the dragons before they got all mixed in with their men? They could have wiped out a shit ton of the zombies with 2-3 passes. Why not have some fire to pour down the walls? [Or have some downward facing spikes like you do for dogs that try to escape their fences?](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/51/aa/b0/51aab090739cbd173e96ed7be2b9d0bd.jpg) Like that but dragonglass.
8,3,The Long Night,Disappointed at the missed opportunity to kill Sean Bean again
8,3,The Long Night,"I’m just emotionally drained. BUT, I figured out Cleganebowl. Obviously Jon doesn’t want the throne so he’ll be like “yo Dany, it’s all yours.” So they’ll defeat Cersei’s army with the 10 survivors of the battle of winterfell. They capture her and Dany wants to show the Seven Kingdoms that she will be a fair ruler so she puts Cersei on trial. She goes through some stuff (like Tyrion with his trial) but ultimately she will demand a trial by combat-her champion being the Mountain. And the Hound will be the other champion. All this will take place in episode 5. All of episode 6 then is Cleganebowl. The Hound wins. The end"
8,3,The Long Night,Anyone else have to remind themselves early on that you don't become a wight if they bite you?
8,3,The Long Night,.... I can't believe they are treating the others as a side plot... No explanation? No additional lore? Just big threat dealt with now move along to petty politics?
8,3,The Long Night,The night king hit us with that [r/2healthbars](http://reddit.com/r/2healthbars) nonsense for a second there.
8,3,The Long Night,Somehow I’m disappointed in how few main characters died that episode.
8,3,The Long Night,Lmao Lyanna Mormont got fuckin boomed
8,3,The Long Night,[removed]
8,3,The Long Night,"I get that people are pissed that Cersei is the ""final boss"" but honestly it makes perfect sense and fits with everything that has happened in the show.

Humanity is its own worst enemy.  Humans being dicks are why the children of the forest made the Night King, for 99% of the rest of the story it's humans killing one another and just generally being awful.

If it ended with them killing the Night King and celebrating because ""yay we believed in each other and set aside our differences!"" I would have been truly disappointed."
8,3,The Long Night,Was not expecting the Night King to be the miniboss.
8,3,The Long Night,"So we just went through an entire series of buildup for Jon and the Night King, only for Arya to sneak attack him out of nowhere?"
8,3,The Long Night,"CGI dragons cost so much, they couldn't afford any lights on set..."
8,3,The Long Night,"This will get buried but I loved the fact the dagger that was meant to kill bran saved him in the end. Very beautiful.

Thanks for the gold!"
8,3,The Long Night,"Night King: In hindsight, having my armor commissioned by the guy who made the Death Star was a stupid move on my part."
8,3,The Long Night,"I honestly can't believe how many people actually survived, with practically everyone on the front lines."
8,3,The Long Night,"Holy shit, I was lowkey expecting Theon to stand up and do the whole what is dead may never die thing and stab the Night King in the back but Arya's kill was fuckin awesome."
8,3,The Long Night,"Night King: I’m unstoppable, I’m the greatest      there ever was

Arya: Hold my beer"
8,3,The Long Night,Arya!!!!! WHAT DO WE SAY TO DEATH?
8,3,The Long Night,A girl is Arya Stark and she has saved her home
8,3,The Long Night,"Bit sad to see the Night King go just like that, no fight, no reveal, no surprise dialogue, no nothing. In the end he did all this to kill Bran. Why? And what the heck was Bran doing all that time?"
8,3,The Long Night,"“What do we say to the god of death?” 

“Not today”"
8,3,The Long Night,"First few seasons: this guy is awesome, looks like he's the hero... dies  
This episode: they will all die... nobody dies."
8,3,The Long Night,I'm glad Bran could see what was going on because nobody else fucking could. lol
8,3,The Long Night,they did my boy Ghost dirty what the fuck
8,3,The Long Night,I was kind of hoping for a Jon v Night King sword fight.
8,3,The Long Night,That little smirk on the Night King's face after taking a full blast from Drogon was epic.
8,3,The Long Night,ALL of Arya's scenes were more stressful than all the battle scenes combined!
8,3,The Long Night,"The REAL question you’re all forgetting about:

WHY DID THE LORD OF LIGHT BRING JON BACK?"
8,3,The Long Night,"All you bitching about the NK getting a weak death he deserved it when he didn't one on one John, he was a pussy and died like one."
8,3,The Long Night,"Arya literally told the God of death ""not today""

Most badass chick of all time."
8,3,The Long Night,Loved that the smallest warrior defeated the giant.
8,3,The Long Night,“Stick em with the pointy end” was a nice touch especially considering the ending. Arya is truly the God of Death.
8,3,The Long Night,"Bran to Theon: “You’re a good man”.

This was so beautiful and perfect for Theon to hear."
8,3,The Long Night,I loved not being able to see a fucking thing all episode
8,3,The Long Night,Sooo about those dragon shots above the clouds. Lemme get one of those HD wallpapers please.
8,3,The Long Night,[deleted]
8,3,The Long Night,I just thought it was soo amazing how Beric Dondarrion and the Hound’s purpose to the Lord of Light was to help and save Arya so she could get to the Night King and kill him. Such a good loop.
8,3,The Long Night,I’ve never wanted to watch Sam die more throughout an entire episode
8,3,The Long Night,Lyanna Mormon is a damn badass.
8,3,The Long Night,[deleted]
8,3,The Long Night,I liked it better when I thought the NK was going to skip Winterfell and fly to Kings Landing to show all those doubters who’s boss.

Jon leaves Ghost - what are you doing !? pet him at least ?"

8,4,The Last of the Starks,Jon may be the rightful king of the iron throne but he is a terrible dog owner.

8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Jon promising Dany that nothing will change felt like something Ned Stark would say. Also, Jon not saying goodbye to Ghost was some /r/petthedamndog material.

8,4,The Last of the Starks,Seeing Bron actually threaten Tyrion and Jaime was kind of shocking. Maybe he was just bluffing to make sure he still got some land after the war but damn. Thought he was a bro.

8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Okay so HANG ON A SECOND -- Tyrion just showed Euron that he knows Cersei is pregnant with a kid.  There is NO WAY he should know that, from Euron's perspective -- Tyrion only knows because he talked to Cersei a ways back, LONG before Euron and Cersei did the deed... meaning Euron now KNOWS that this baby can't be his, because how the hell could Tyrion have heard about it???"

8,4,The Last of the Starks,Did they just ship Ghost off to a farm upstate with Tormund and Sam? Really not a fan of this.

8,4,The Last of the Starks,We couldn't get at least a head pat for Ghost before Jon leaves? He lost his ear for fuck's sake.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,I just don’t know who I want to win the throne anymore... also Jaime broke my heart
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Been a while since I've given the show a full rewatch. The few old episodes I've seen this month gave me the impression Bronn was actually turning into a decent guy, especially when he jumped infront of dragon fire to save Jaime. His heel-turn is confusing me. Seems out of character."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,One knight stand.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,We now know more about Bran’s wheelchair than the Night King... love that

Ghost better come back"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Loved Arya's callback to her childhood... ""I'm not a lady. That's not me."""
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Arya is not the Mary Sue. Euron is.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Anybody else frustrated with just how violently Bronn was written in that scene in the pub? I understand he's a mercenary, and is used to killing. I also know he wants his damn Castle. But the writing, his lines, the harshness in his voice... It all seemed a bit too rough coming from him, while being directed at Tyrion and Jamie."

8,4,The Last of the Starks,So last episode people complained that not enough characters died. But now we see they were left alive so they can suffer.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,WORST THING I EVER SAW WAS HIM NOT HUGGING GHOST GOODBYE. Fucking monster
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"This episode felt like it should've been part of a 10 episode season, not 6."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Shoutout to Ghost getting to live out the rest of his days on a farm up north. My mom says my childhood pup Sparky is absolutely loving it up there.....
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Sansa could't keep her oath for 5 fucking seconds lol. When will the men from the north ever learn how the game is played. Cersei and Littlefinger taught her well.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Why did Missandei not grab Cersei and yeet off the wall?
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Jon... this bitch didn’t even give Ghost a goodbye pet. He’s cancelled.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,POD IN THE BACKGROUND WITH A THREESOME !!
8,4,The Last of the Starks,So Jon bailed on Ghost because he has a way cooler new pet..... WELL GUESS WHAT BINCH
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Arya and Sansa about to have some brilliant reactions to news, lets see how they take it.

Nah smash cut away from a great reveal to them. Cheers D+D"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Jon, you couldn't even pet that good boi goodbye? You suck."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"“We can... I’ve just told you how”

Aaaaandd now you’re single"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"I think that was Emilia Clarke’s best performance of the series.  

As a Daenerys supporter, this episode broke my heart. I’m not saying Dany was always perfect, but she definitely tried and wanted to be a beacon of good and now she’s broken. She’s lost the most innocent person in her circle, she’s being plotted against by her advisors, and her lover has a stronger claim to the throne that she’s worked so hard to win."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Is no one else surprised that Bronn came out of nowhere, broke Tyrion’s nose, threatened to kill both of them, and walked away as the king/ruler of Riverrun, and just left like nothing?

The fuck?"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Freeing people from tyrants without care of the cost sounds like something a tyrant would say
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Dany at like 300 meters in the air and can't see the big ass fleet trying to shoot ballistas with the aim of gods at her dragon. Seriously what a shit moment, didn't even made sense lol"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"God the heart break for Brienne, Grey Worm Gendry, Ghost, Dany and Tormund (even tho he got over it rather quick)"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,If Tyrion and Qyburn fight would it be considered hand to hand combat?
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Jaime and Brienne finally doing the nasty. Hell yeah. Feel sorry for Tormund though. That scene with the Hound was too funny.

So, Jon just gave away Ghost like that? Lol, who is writing this? They would have been better just killing him off two seasons ago.

Also, why didn't Dany just flank or fly Drogon behind Euron ships and attack from behind?

Edit: I just watched Euron ballista scene again and like a lot of people are saying below it should be able to rotate 360 but attacking from behind is still more effective than dipping out of there and allowing her ships and soliders to be destroyed. Attack from behind, stay low, and don't fly in a f**king straight line. Do the dragons have zero maneuverabiliy or something? And can only fly straight at threats? The ballistas are in front of Euron ships and the shooters view of the back is obstructed by the sails and masts. They have make the dragons ridiculously useless in the show. I wonder how the Tergaryen conquered all of Westros if it was this easily to take down dragons."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"~Emotional trophies~

Cringiest — Gendry opening his mouth to speak to arya with dreamy/lovey eyes

Funniest — Jamie blocking Tormund from following Brienne

Most shocking — Rhaegal getting shot out of the goddam sky

Saddest — Jamie leaving Brienne to cry her fucking eyes out

Most angering — seeing Missandei  in chains"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,My boy Pod about to lay some pipe in the north to keep things warm

Army of the dead

Or one pirate boye"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Brienne can fucking get it!
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"I know probably no one will read this cause there are literally 20,000 comments. 

But at the end of the preview we see Euron staring into the sun, as the remaining dragon cries out. 

The tactic she's using (it looks like) is the same Japanese Zero pilots used to use. Primarily for kamikaze attacks but also for regular attacks. You fly up super high until you're in the same direction as the sun according to your enemy, and you dive straight toward them. 

It's near impossible to see properly because of the sun. And if you line it up right you could be washed out entirely by light. She's going to use literal Kamikaze strats to roast Euron."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Remember when cersi was a kid, she went to visit a witch in the woods? The witch said she'll only have 3 children during her entire life.. foreshadowing much??"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Did anyone accidentally watch a rerun in which Tyrion underestimates Cersei’s ruthlessness and Dany’s entire army forgets that Euron exists?
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Anyone seeing the parallels between Cersei and Daenerys losing their children? Both becoming more violent and vengeful as their children die and trying to protect the ones they have left? No?

8,4,The Last of the Starks,A king who won't pet his dog/wolf goodbye is no king of mine.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"I think the saddest part of this episode is that Jon didn't say goobye to ghost. Never even told him that he was a ""good boi"""

We don't know what fucking Harry Strickland looks like, and neither does Cersei. Its Daario and the Second Sons in disguise. That's why there's no elephants.

EDIT: Harry *Strickland*"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Tormund would never treat Brienne like this
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Don’t let Dany blowing a 3-0 dragon lead distract you from the fact that the Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 lead against the New England Patriots

8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Bran, the single most important individual in all the world, again does nothing to help anyone do anything."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,How does Euron not think it's weird that Tyrion knows Cersei is pregnant?
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Was Dany the only person who actually gave Arya any credit for saving all their asses?
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"So, a lot to take in this episode.

* Jon leaving Ghost, who is clearly injured and deserves to be called a good boy. This fucking pissed me off.
* Tormund is always a win, ""and after all that, this fucker comes North and takes her from me, just takes her like that.""
* Euron Greyjoy is more powerful and sneaky than even the Night King. Like, sure sure.
* Daenerys is going to be the mad queen, and she's fucking manipulative. I almost bought her act with Jon, before she revealed her true intentions.
* Jon ""Aegon Targaryen"" Stark/Snow, seems to be in for another raise, how many is that now? Lord Commander, King in The North, and now King of the Seven Kingdoms. His titles keep growing.
* Cleganebowl is happening!
* Arya and Hound on the road again, love their adventures. I'd watch just their own spin off show too.
* Sansa and Hound reunion, I was so waiting for that. ""Little Bird""
* Sansa is growing quite a lot on me, she has endured a lot but I truly believe that she is the smartest person in GoT right now.
* Hotpie reunion soon?
* Tyrion and Varys know about Aegon Targaryen. Literally it's spreading like wildfire
* And finally, Bron got into Winterfell, threatened Tyrion and Jaime and just fucked off. So, that happened, and maybe we are supposed to believe that he might kill one of them, I doubt it.
* If anyone forgot, some Wintertown girl is going to see magic cock from Podrick. That lad has got some game."

8,4,The Last of the Starks,and bran continues to be fucking useless.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"You’re really telling me Jon doesn’t even give Ghost a pat on the head? No ‘see ya boy thanks for all the help fighting zombies and saving my life countless times’? And Dany just plops Drogon down in firing range of the weapons which just killed her other child? And two apparently smart men just casually, openly discussing treason in the **loudest room ever**? Oh, and wtf was the Bronn scene?!

I understand I’m watching a fantasy show with undead people and magic and dragons, but you still expect characters to behave in a particular way and the implausibility of certain actions and scenarios in this one just got to me.  Felt really lazy in a lot of places and I’m feeling so conflicted right now."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,[deleted]
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Honestly at this point how can you not be #teamSansa? 

Everyone else is so goddamn brainless."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,[removed]
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Hot bowl of Mad Queen stirring up real nicely.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,So Euron’s ships have a cloaking ability or what? I don’t think I’ve ever seen such clear skies on this show and Dany was on a god damn *dragon*. But somehow she gets snuck up on by an entire fleet of ships.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"The show is moving at 1600 mph, and what’s funny is all of these scenes were great, but what made the episode terrible for me is that they all happened within seconds of one another. Within like 6.5 seconds they’re at Winterfell, then Dragonstone, then Euron kills the dragon out of nowhere, then Sansa hears about it back at Winterfell, then they’re at King’s Landing, and now they’re back at Dragonstone for the next episode. I just cannot fathom how the show-runners only wanted 6 episodes for this season. Great acting as usual, but the ridiculous pacing makes this one of my most disliked episodes of the series. I loved the first three of the season, but this one was really frustrating. Also RIP Missandei"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Hot take she should have sacrificed her life and taken Cersei down with her at the end
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Welp, Daenerys is going to end up like her father."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Wow, they spent all their CG budget on the battle of Winterfell that they couldn't even have a scene where Jon says a proper goodbye to Ghost."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Dany is starting to become the Mad Queen, she can't handle not being in power."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Honestly, the way Jon treated Ghost was the most upsetting thing to me from this episode. Pet your dog, dick."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Bran can’t give anybody a heads up for what’s on the seas?
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Can we bring back the Night King now?
8,4,The Last of the Starks,I’m a LIFE long fan of thrones and I’ll probably get down voted here but I’d anyone else just completely like “meh” about this season? I don’t hate it by any means but Like wtf is HBO doing to my favorite show.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Unfinished business = CLEGANEBOWL!!
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Aside from Ned Stark losing his head, no one has been more disrespected than Ghost. Not even a final hug or pat from Jon."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,dany about to burn this whole city to the ground
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Also, Dany is definitely dying this season. She’s lost damn near all her support. Good on Sansa in this episode, very Petyr Baelish."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Is anyone else upset that they didn't show Sansa and Arya's reactions to learning that Jon is actually their cousin? Also, way to bitch out Jon, making Bran tell them"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Here’s how this all ends.

Jamie will kill Cersei and his unborn baby to repent for all the terrible things he’s done throughout his life. This will spare the city from being burned and innocent people being slaughtered. But, he will be sure to make it clear the Euron that he was a pawn and the child is not his. This will be episode 5.

In the final episode the sorting out of who will sit the iron throne will take place as the news about Jon Snow’s lineage begins to spread. Daenerys, who has become increasingly unhinged, will do whatever is necessary to be the one true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, including killing Jon. The show ends with her talking the Iron Throne as the tyrant she vowed to rid the world of. After all, the Targaryen’s are often mad. The North will not bend the knee to her after she does this, nor will a lot of others. The uncertainty and quest for the throne will never be over. There will never be one true, safe ruler of the Seven Kingdoms."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Patch notes v8.04:

>We saw that some players are abusing the Dragon Rush tactic which gives serious avantadge against any player building a mercenary army. We want to give to the players of the game (of thrones) more viable build paths and strategies. 

**DRAGONS**

* Armor reduced by 50%
* Chance to dodge reduced by 75%
* Sight radius reduced by 500 meters
* Traveling speed increased by 300%

&#x200B;

**BALLISTA**

* Now deals additional damage against ships.
* You can carry Ballista units in a ship ( Still not elephants, we are working on it ).

&#x200B;

**MINOR CHANGES:**

* **Varys** (Hero unit) fire resistance reduced to 0.
* **Arya** (Hero unit) now have a new skill ""Heartbreaker"".

&#x200B;

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed Bug that allows some players to resurrect Dragons without investing points in the ""Lord of light"" skill tree.
* Fixed Bug that makes the ""White walkers"" race to lose when their hero is killed.

&#x200B;

**Current bugs:**

* We noticed that dothraki units AI have a strange behaviour while ""Fire blade"" buff is on."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"This episode was great until people started leaving Winterfell.  

Sansa: I promise not to tell.

2 minutes later

Sansa: JK Tyrion you won't believe this.

Euron continues his magical I-can-do-anything abilities with his super sneaky stealth fleet and perfect accuracy at extreme range.

Dany and every single adviser of hers just standing 100 feet away from Kings Landing with no backup, why the hell wouldn't Cersei just execute them with those dozen+ ballista right there?"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,[deleted]
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"shit Missandei's sigil was a fucking butterfly, what a babe"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"I **LOVE** this show fam, but I swear to god, each episode is getting dumber. Now we have boats sneaking up on dragons? How the fuck do you not see a fleet of boats from as high up in the sky as Dany was? Also the range in which they shot Raegal compared to the ""safety"" distance it shows later in the episode is WAY different. Also how do they hit this fucking dragon with 3 impossible shots in a row then proceed to miss like 20 times in succession? These ballistas were demonstratively useless previously, yet now they're a plot device to kill a dragon so they're somehow much easier to aim/fire at moving objects while at SEA and apparently larger than before. Also LOL @ Tyrion knowing about the baby with Greyjoy next to Cersei not questioning the statement. Also Missandei literally could have taken Cersei out jumping with her instead of just standing around waiting to die in her chains (Cersei literally grabs her by the arm, no one else is anywhere close. Jesus H Christ they're just dialing it in! I can't stop watching, cause I'm fully attached to these characters and the action, but the writers or SOMEONE is being lazy as fuck."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Literally everyone who went to Kings Landing should be dead
8,4,The Last of the Starks,I saw way too much this episode. Goddamn it HBO turn your brightness down.
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"When Tyrion approached the wall I honestly thought I was gonna have a heart attack.

8,4,The Last of the Starks,Who tf wheeled Bran away from Tyrion mid-conversation?
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"The remaining dragon is going to be armored up for the battle at kings landing, I’m calling it now"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Girl this is the THIRD time your fleet’s been ambushed and the second time you encountered a ballista! Maybe you should have ambushed the Iron Fleet at night and burned them to pieces before sending your diminished fleet south!!!
8,4,The Last of the Starks,I haven't seen someone get curved harder then gendry since highschool days with graphs
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"And on top of everything else Bran finally got to brag about his wheels, must have held that in for a while."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Seems kind of funny to me that the dragons were built up to be some huge threat.

Viserion gets killed by 1 spear throw, and Rhaegal gets a bunch of arrows to him and they're immediately eliminated. Rhaegal took a beating last episode too.

Like, all Cersei had to do was say hey, get everyone to built powerful crossbows. Easy peasy.

Of course, the first 2 dragons weren't fully grown and Drogon is. Who knows what the scorpions could do to Drogon. He did get hit by 1 before and got away."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"I can sure relate to Daenerys. 

She brought her armies to save the world from the White Walkers. 

Her armies are decimated. She lost her closest friend. She receives no reverence and some contempt. 

She heads back south, loses her second child. Loses another best friend. 

Why is she losing so much? Because her advisers cautioned her to have restraint and listen to them.  Her advisers have absolutely and completely failed her. 

How can a person not be tempted by violent impulses?"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Welp, MAYBE someone should listen to Sansa for literally once. She is one of the few people who understands proper politics and it’s evident she does care about the people. How is it that no one will take her seriously"
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Dany is the worst dragon owner and battle strategist ever
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"Every part of the plot was written to mold Dany into Mad King 2: Back in the Habit. She warned Jon of exactly what would happen if he blabbed his secret. Her warning played out like a plot summary this episode! 

And then strategically she gets placed in the shittiest situation of anyone: her dragon dies in a super fucked up way and then her best friend gets beheaded. And that friends last words?! DRACRYS!! OF COURSE SHE'S GOING TO BURN KINGS LANDING NOW. Who the fuck wouldn't after that trauma conga line along with her very rational paranoia..."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,"I think we’re all in agreement .... Ghost seeing Jon off should have been a major highlight tonight, hugs and a ‘good boy’ were in order here, major disappointment."
8,4,The Last of the Starks,Jaime really took Brienne’s virginity and said see ya lmao

8,5,The Bells,"Tyrion: If the bells ring, that means they are surrendering, you may be able to spare some of the innocents. 

Dany: K ;)"
8,5,The Bells,"At the end all I could think was ""that horse had a weird day""."
8,5,The Bells,"The mad queen completed her fathers last words, she burnt them all."
8,5,The Bells,I wonder how many letters were Varys able to send
8,5,The Bells,"Confirmed: The Hound is worth 80% of one Barristan Selmy.

""Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!""

8,5,The Bells,Qyburn's cause of death was literally: tried to stop Cleganebowl.
8,5,The Bells,I like that Cersei commented on the Red Keep never falling and then dies due to the literal falling of the Red Keep.
8,5,The Bells,"I’m glad they showed Dany’s messy braid, best girl Missandei wasn’t there."
8,5,The Bells,Tywin Lannister died on Father’s Day. Cersei Lannister died on Mother’s Day. That is all.

8,5,The Bells,"Instead of a character arc, Jamie had more of a character circle"
8,5,The Bells,Thought Arya died but she only woke up in Asbesteros
8,5,The Bells,"""Yeah, that looks like you.""

-Sandor Fucking Clegane"
8,5,The Bells,I'm starting to wonder what GRRM actually told them about the ending.
8,5,The Bells,After all that buildup the Golden Company had ZERO impact on anything whatsoever lol
8,5,The Bells,The Hound’s father talk with Arya at the last minute was satisfying. Fitting for their relationship throughout the whole show.
8,5,The Bells,Why they gotta do Harry and his golden boys like that.
8,5,The Bells,If Jon says one more time “you are my queen” I WILL RAGE
8,5,The Bells,"Cersei: *watching Cleganebowl* k, so.. I think I left the oven on so I'm gonna go..."
8,5,The Bells,Zombie Clegane looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Mr. Freeze
8,5,The Bells,Varys not getting any last words was brutal.
8,5,The Bells,"“Our fathers were evil men. All of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to leave the world better than we found it” - Dany 

Tyler the creator - “so that was a fucking lie”"
8,5,The Bells,Fuck me if you watched that episode alone you’d think the Lannisters might be the good guys
8,5,The Bells,"I never thought I'd say it, but I'm glad Jorah died, so he wouldn't have lived to see this."
8,5,The Bells, I wonder how the people who named their daughter's Khaleesi feel?
8,5,The Bells,"Queen of the Ashes, like the prophecy in Qarth

Edit: Thanks for the silver!"
8,5,The Bells,I can't believe Robert Baratheon could have actually made the right move by ordering the assassination of Daenerys.

8,5,The Bells,DOES ANYONE KNOW IF SER POUNCE IS ALRIGHT?
8,5,The Bells,The Hound will go down as one of the most badass characters. A fitting ending for him.

8,5,The Bells,Funny how Cersei still had someone who loved her till the end whereas Dany has no one.
8,5,The Bells,Sandor Clegane. And now his bowl has ended.
8,5,The Bells,[deleted]
8,5,The Bells,"It was a really awesome touch to show the dragon fire igniting the wildfire the mad king put below the city. Symbolizes she is what she didn’t want to become, her father"
8,5,The Bells,I was really digging Arya's whole Sweeney Todd look.
8,5,The Bells,I guess Dany's coin finally landed.
8,5,The Bells,[removed]
8,5,The Bells,Sandor killed those Kingsguard like Palpatine killed those Jedi Masters LMAOO
8,5,The Bells,"Goodbye, Euron.

Thank you writers for a Euron-free last episode!"
8,5,The Bells,I'm just happy the Hound went out in a blaze of glory.
8,5,The Bells,Lena is goddamn phenomenal. Cersei was an evil gift that Lena fucking nailed for 8 seasons.
8,5,The Bells,It is really sad to see Dany free innocent slaves then slaughter a city of women and children
8,5,The Bells,I can empathize with Dany. My neighbors have wind chimes.
8,5,The Bells,"Arya’s like “where’s Gendry, I’m ready to be a lady”"
8,5,The Bells,"“Tens of thousands of innocent lives. One not so innocent dwarf. Seems like a pretty fair trade. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have survived my childhood. You were the only one who didn’t treat me like a monster. You were all I had.”

This is now my new favorite Tyrion quote. I teared up a little. So happy he was ready to repay the favor.

Edit: changed slaves to lives"
8,5,The Bells,"Bran to Tyrion next episode:

""Cersei looked so lovely whilst the rubble shattered her skull."""
8,5,The Bells,"Euron straight Undertakered Jaime with some of those moves lmao. Smackdown 2019 Kings Landing edition, now with flamethrowers and tag team Cleganebowl"
8,5,The Bells,"Jon: I got 99 problems but a bitch ain’t- 

Jon: 100 problems. I now have 100 problems."
8,5,The Bells,[dany this ep](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HRqxc8ewnC4)
8,5,The Bells,I see it all now.  Arya is going to kill the Queen... just not the Queen we thought she was going to kill.
8,5,The Bells,Had a feeling that Arya wouldnt end up killing Cersei.
8,5,The Bells,Dany is 100% dead next week
8,5,The Bells,"Dany: “Nobody likes me, everybody hates me, guess I’ll go... burn an entire city and kill millions of people”"
8,5,The Bells,"So it looks like Jaime genuinely did love Cersei and didn’t go back to kill her, he just wanted to be with her."
8,5,The Bells,"I was really impressed by the destruction that ONE DRAGON can do. This may be the first time(and only) we saw something like that.

&#x200B;

I cant even imagine how destructive 3 dragons could be."
8,5,The Bells,Qyburn's death was fucking HILARIOUS
8,5,The Bells,"Added to the list:

8,5,The Bells,"Sansa ""I told you so"" Stark"
8,5,The Bells,"Jon snow as soon as Grey Worm threw the spear: 

\*Wait a minute...That wasn't very cash money\*"
8,5,The Bells,"This episode was

50% dragon burning the city and killing people 

48% slowmo

2% oh fuck is Arya dead?"
8,5,The Bells,Dany's hair in the beginning was so bad because Missandei is dead....
8,5,The Bells,Dany what the FUCK
8,5,The Bells,This is what happens when you don’t get Dany a Mother’s Day gift.
8,5,The Bells,"This will get buried, but did anyone REALLY want to see Jon vs Greyworm once shit hit the fan?"
8,5,The Bells,I for one welcome Queen Trogdor
8,5,The Bells, Now we know why Jon couldn’t say bye to ghost that CGI budget was paid for and spent fam
8,5,The Bells,Why the fuck did Dany go around burning peasants for an hour straight?
8,5,The Bells,Attention southerners who survived the dragon queen attack! If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with Mesothelioma you may be entitled to financial compensation.
8,5,The Bells,well Dany is arguably worse than her father after that little stunt
8,5,The Bells,I was sad to see Varys die but then it looked like his head popped back up on Clegane’s body.
8,5,The Bells,"RIP Hound, he died doing what he loved, Cleganebowling"
8,5,The Bells,"Jon Snow this episode: Davos, are we the baddies?"
8,5,The Bells,"The hound got even with his brother by pushing him into a fire.

Qyburns curiosity got the best of him.

This was excellent."
8,5,The Bells,The moment the camera panned in on Jon's face and him realizing they were the bad guys really broke my heart. What an incredible turn of events.
8,5,The Bells,Still believe that Brienne should have chosen Tormund over Jamie! UGH
8,5,The Bells,I think Varys might've been on to something...
8,5,The Bells,"Sandor laughing through Cleganebowl was the best possible way to send him off.     

Out of the frying pan and into the Fire    


EDIT: For those asking, the last line is from an Eric Hoffer quote:    

**""We feel free when we escape - even if it be but from the frying pan to the fire.""**    

EDIT 2: It seems that ""Out of the frying pan and into the fire"" is a much older expression dating back to the 15th Century. I first heard it in the context of the above Hoffer quote and never thought to look beyond.     

Stay woke, kids."
8,5,The Bells,Happy mother's day everybody

8,5,The Bells,Cersei of all people gets a romantic ending. Perfect.
8,5,The Bells,That shot of Drogon coming out of the darkness was beautiful.
8,5,The Bells,That nerd Qyburn getting smashed by the mountain was the best part of season8.
8,5,The Bells,"Behold, a pale horse, and upon him sat Death"
8,5,The Bells,Turns out valonqar actually means falling rubble
8,5,The Bells,There are probably people who have named their daughter Dany or Daenerys and are now regretting it

8,5,The Bells,"The bells are ringing! Cersei surrenders!

Oop, looks like Dany doesnt want her surrender and is going to burn her in the red keep, cheeky!

Oh Dany.

8,5,The Bells,"Jon Snow tonight: ""are we the baddies?""

And shoutout to the ~~Golden~~ Pyrite Company. Maybe they should have brought those elephants."

8,5,The Bells,"Music on point tho

Edit: mmm when Dany was burning the iron fleet, dat recapitulation of her dragon theme

Edit2: apparently it's a reprise not recapitulation according to my know it all boyfriend 🙄"
8,5,The Bells,the fact that the girl who Arya try to save was carrying a white toy horse like the horse at the end was a nice touch
8,5,The Bells,All this episode was missing was Dany in her underwear cooking meth.
8,5,The Bells,Memes aside this was the goriest episode of GoT ever
8,5,The Bells,Fuck me that was unnecessary Dany
8,5,The Bells,"Anyone else think Varys might be trying to poison Dany? It would make sense why he is so concerned with whether she is eating in the first scene, and why the little girl Martha would be so concerned about the guards watching her."
8,5,The Bells,Well now danys reaction to that reporter asking her if she thought the show ended well and all she did was an awkward laugh is justified
8,5,The Bells,[removed]
8,5,The Bells,Qyburn getting yeeted into that rock is the most hilarious thing I've seen all week
8,5,The Bells,Damn. I did not see that coming. Good thing for the Hound. I really appreciated Jaimie not dying at the hands of Euron. In a twisted way I loved Jon's face after realizing Varys and Sansa were right after all.
8,5,The Bells,🔔 SHAME 🔔
8,5,The Bells,Get you a general like Greyworm. He sees his queen burning hundreds of innocent people alive and just wastes that guy with zero hesitation
8,5,The Bells,The Hound really said “fuck this shit i’m out” and took The Mountain with him....what a fucking LEGEND!
8,5,The Bells,Tyrion and Jaime’s goodbye was one of the most emotional moments in the history of the show

We listened to the community feedback on the subject of Euron and his ballista accuracy/damage. We also realized that the dragons were lacking some major defense against projectiles. We think that everyone will be happy with the changes we have implemented for this patch. 

- we have reduced the number of ballistas that can shoot in the Iron fleet to 1.
- Euron is no longer able to fire the ballista personally.
- Euron swim stamina upped 400% to compensate for these changes.
- Euron now recieves a 60% damage bonus vs crippled units.
- Drogon Dodge chance upped by 100% for the first two ballista shots fired."
8,5,The Bells,Dany got some serious PTSD for ringing bells
8,5,The Bells," I was kind of touched by Qyburns loyalty to Cersei. He could’ve just fucked off after seeing all the death and destruction, but he stayed true to her.

Dany going full psycho was expected, but still saddening, and Jon realizing what she’s become and the look of horro r on his face was also saddening. :(
I don’t know how I feel about Jaime and Cersei’s conclusion. I was hoping for him to kill Cersei to spare the city suffering, but going back to the woman he loved and dying with her in his arms also seems a little fitting. “The things I do for love.”"

8,5,The Bells,">I’ve seen so many posts and comments about Jaime’s arc being ruined, and how they actually think he’s going back to defend/be with Cersei again. Bronn literally just told him that Cersei sent him there to kill him and Tyrion. Jaime then explains how he’s done so many unspeakable things just to be with her, only for her to turn around and try to have him assassinated. For people to not initially pick up on it is one thing, but to make a post talking about how the writers have “ruined Jaime” because you can’t read into his dialogue is just [ignorant and a waste of everyone’s time](https://np.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bl9a8p/spoilers_the_sheer_number_of_people_who_cant_read/?sort=confidence).

Oh... that was easy"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Who knew Drogon would have the greatest character development out of them all
8,6,The Iron Throne,Jon: How the fuck did you get up here Arya
8,6,The Iron Throne,Anyone else wondering why Bran wants a master of whispers when he IS the master of whispers? Like he could say “a little bird told me” and mean it literally.
8,6,The Iron Throne,How the hell are there that many Dothraki still alive
8,6,The Iron Throne,what is the Nights Watch watching for now exactly?? They basically just sent Jon to summer camp
8,6,The Iron Throne,So like...what are the Dothraki gonna do now? They don't seem like the farming type
8,6,The Iron Throne,Gawd Emilia Clarke really knows how to deliver a war speech in a foreign language
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Too bad Jaime and Cersei didn't hide under a table or something, or they'd probably have survived pretty easily looking at that 1 brick layer on them."
8,6,The Iron Throne,DAENERYS TARGRAYEN HAS BE ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFF CONTENTION
8,6,The Iron Throne,"""And I know a killer when I see one"" wow arya very perceptive insight into the woman who just burninated an entire surrendered city"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Drogon: Jon, there is something I must do.

Jon: I am ready to meet my fate, do what you must.

*Drogon burns the iron throne*

Drogon: THIS STUPID THRONE IS AN OSHA VIOLATION"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Bran: the king in the south

Arya: the queen in the west

Sansa: the queen in the north

Jon: the king in the super north"
8,6,The Iron Throne,HBO showcasing all their shows like don't leave!
8,6,The Iron Throne,Drogon: I understand symbolism.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Thank god Jaime and Cersei didn't find a dumpster to hide under.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Bran ends up on the iron throne so they throw some wheels on that metal bitch and he wheels himself around Kings Landing saying weird shit and creeping people out.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Dany: ""I'm going to break the wheel.""

*doesn't break the wheel*

Sam: ""Hey, why don't we break the wheel?""

Everyone: ""Sit the fuck down, SAM!!!!""

And they all lived happily ever after."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Is Drogon an honorary member of the good boy club for his reaction to danys death?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Drogon gave Jon an ocular patdown, determined he was not a threat and cleared him for entry."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Arya ""Christopher Columbus"" Stark"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Lol what if the ending reveals Westeros to be a Westworld park?
8,6,The Iron Throne,I think there are more Dothraki and Unsullied here than there were at The Battle of Winterfell.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Jon wishing he had Duolingo app.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Holy fuck he really did it.
8,6,The Iron Throne,This Jon/Tyrion conversation is a lot like the reddit convos of the last week
8,6,The Iron Throne,Sam introducing the concept of democracy and getting laughed at may be the highlight of the season.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Anyone who is still hanging out at King's Landing is going to get Mesothelioma.
8,6,The Iron Throne," Dany to unsullied : ""You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant""

Tyrion , Jon and Me: ""And where are those people now?"""
8,6,The Iron Throne,Now I know why this Episode is 90 minutes. It's going to take Tyrion like 60 to walk through the rubble of King's Landing.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Varys' ashes saying I told you so haha
8,6,The Iron Throne,I was hoping Jamie’s hand would be on Brienne’s desk as a paperweight
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Yeah, I’m gonna need that shot of Dany with the wings behind her as a high-res wallpaper."
8,6,The Iron Throne,How come no one has mentioned the lineage of Jon Snow at all? What was the point of revealing his parentage -- for conflict?
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,Brienne coming in with the Wikipedia Edit on Jaime’s page.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So the unsullied just... leave? All that war just to leave?

Why doesn’t Bran just say “ok, they’re gone, Jon you’re free!”"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Brienne writing in the Book of Brothers is actually a nice touch. I'll give D&D that.
8,6,The Iron Throne,The rest of the episode is just forty minutes of Jon crying.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"At first I thought Drogon maybe thought Daenerys tried to sit on the sword throne and got stabbed on it, lol.
""DID THE THRONE DO THIS JON? I'LL FUCKING KILL IT!""
""Y-Yes..."""
8,6,The Iron Throne,So the Unsullied liberated the citizens of Kings Landing from... life?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"How the fuck does anyone know Jon stabbed her, the dragon flew off with the evidence."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Oh shit, Arya is going to go off and find Australia!"
8,6,The Iron Throne,It was an honor following this show with you all. Tonight our watch ends but what is dead may never die!
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Enemy king: Bran, we gonna invade you.

Bran: I've already foreseen you lose.

Enemy: shit"
8,6,The Iron Throne,I can’t help but thinking that Jaime and Cersei could have lived if they stepped about 6 ft to the side.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"No time for anything important, but there's always time to make fun of Edmure Tully."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Why was Tyrion allowed to monologue, suggest a king, and then campaign for Bran, all while being on trial for treason? Nothing makes sense."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Greyworm to Tyrion: YOU DONT DESERVE TO SPEAK....

*Tyrion proposes new king, everyone votes and Greyworm sits back quietly like the calm person he is*  it made my husband and I laugh.

At least we like the Starks I guess"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"When Khaleesi gives you a broken wheel, make a wheelchair."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Dany's death ended up being just like her father's. Died right next to the Iron Throne after being stabbed by the person they trusted the most
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Tyrion went from being the hand of the king, to prisoner, to hand of the queen, to prisoner, to hand of the king. What a wild ride he's had."
8,6,The Iron Throne,HE👏PET👏THE👏DAMN👏DOG👏
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Stark queen in the north, Stark king in the super north, Stark king in the south, and a stark exploring the new world. I see this as an absolute win!"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"That kid who drank his mom's breast milk for so long turned out tall...wonder if there is a correlation

SIR PODRICK!! here to push Bran's wheelchair around because Bran can become King, become a fucking raven, but he can't use his arms to push himself around

If they really want to break the wheel get someone to carry Bran around

IM SORRY how did jon try to go see Dany, run into Grey Worm AND have grey worm beat him there????"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion surviving the whole series is something remarkable.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Samwell: “What about democracy?” 

Everyone: *Laughs in totalitarianism*"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Sooo not one person thought to bring up Jon being king? At least for arguments sake, one person could have mentioned Jon."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Was it just me or did that last council meeting feel like the 'credits outtake reel' of a Hangover movie?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"A song of ice and fire.

I'm still working on the ending"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"When Brienne shut the book too fast for the ink to dry. 

That summarized this season for me."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"#JON DID PET GHOST

IM HAPPY NOW"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Tyrion: “we should vote on the new king to decide what we do with Jon Snow.”

Grey worm: “fine”

Tyrion: *chuckles and stares at all the northerners at the meeting*"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Bran: Why do you think I came all this way

Also Bran, literally 3 minutes later: I don't want to be king"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Wouldn’t it be funny if after Bran becomes king he chooses to execute Tyrion and Jon anyway
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Bran says, ""why do you think I came all this way?"" Does that imply that he knew he would be king this whole time?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I don't know, I liked her death scene. It seemed like the most realistic way for it to happen. She trusted a person and that person knew she had to die. The way he did it made the most sense. Why do it in a huge way that involves a big battle when she has his trust?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Everyone to Bran: You are now Lord of Winterfell.

Bran: No, I am 3-Eyed Raven

Tyrion: Bran, be the king!

Bran: Okay..."
8,6,The Iron Throne,The sound effect they used for when drogon when Danny was killed were gut wrenching
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,Jon is in an abusive relationship and Tyrion is trying to convince him to leave
8,6,The Iron Throne,So beautiful that Jamie and Cersei died wrapped up together. They looked like they were in the womb again. Birthed together died together
8,6,The Iron Throne,In my head Drogon took Dany to Valyria where she will be reborn as a true Dark queen and conquer Essos before returning to Westeros as an immortal Dragon Queen.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"After Sansa said that they were going to be independent, I was waiting for the rest of the houses to be like, 'Hold up, we can do that? Fuck y'all, we out.'"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"This needs to said but I think Bran is just evil. Couldn't he have stopped all that bloodshed by warging into Drogon, Dany, or even Cersei? I think they were trying to make a point about democracy, but they end up giving the throne to some all knowing all seeing demigod. Not a good look."
8,6,The Iron Throne,iron throne was destroyed so bran could feel more comfortable in his wheelchair
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Samwell: “What about democracy?”

*laughs*"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"The real question is, who braided Dany's hair?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So is Dany seeing Khal Drogo and her unborn child after the throne vision in the House of the Undying foreshadowing that she would die right then? Which is what happened. Just as she was about to sit on the throne, Jon interrupts her and murders her."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Kinda wanna see Greyworm die too now.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Is it just me, or did HBO and the writers put more effort into keeping season 8’s production a secret then actually writing it?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"It's been an honor, everyone. Let's do this one more time."
8,6,The Iron Throne,I am displeased with Bran. Little psychopath watched everywhere get destroyed to just become king and he knew it.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"If the north is it's own kingdom, what's to stop Jon from just going back to Winterfell and hanging out there."
8,6,The Iron Throne,So how did the unsullied even figure out it was Jon if the dragon flew away from the continent with the body and no witnesses other than said dragon ?
8,6,The Iron Throne,Brienne adding to Jamie's passage was the saddest part.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Possible spin off shows:

Arya and the 3 C’s

Jon and Tormund find Santa Claus

Half Man, Bran and the Small council

Sansa gets her groove back"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion dictating the terms of kingship WHILE HE'S A FUCKING PRISONER!!!! And Greyworm just dipping even though he's been there from the start and isn't included in the roundtable. But Bronn threatens Jaime and Tyrion while they're trying to fight the Night King and gets rewarded???? ughhhhhhh
8,6,The Iron Throne,First spinoff: A construction show about making kings landing wheelchair accessible.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So Jon brought everyone together to fight the dead, killed the woman he loved for the greater good...and that's how they repaid him. Nice."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Arya is about to pull a Christopher Columbus.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Bran spent the entire season watching Netflix and he's the King of Westeros now. What a man
8,6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion was the Hand to three rulers of Westeros in the era which followed Robert Baratheon's death. How does his name show up in A Song of Ice and Fire?
8,6,The Iron Throne,How do they know Bran's dick don't work?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"""My sisters will be loyal to the throne.""  Oh man Jon, have you met your sisters?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Can anyone explain to me why they had a vote on king? What made anyone care about Bran (his only qualification was he can’t have kids)? Why the unsullied decided to abide the councils decision? What qualified Bronn to be master of coin besides extorting people? Why Jon didn’t get roasted? Why the Dothraki are super chill about everything and don’t ever want a say? Why Sansa gets a pass from the council for demanding independence? Why no one knows what’s west of Westeros in a world with dragons and magic animal seers? What happened to Arya’s horse? Why does Drogon hate chairs?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Tyrion may be 4'-4"" but in that scene the man stood at 7' tall."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Tyrion: Hand to two failed rulers.

Bran: Third times a charm!"
8,6,The Iron Throne,They really just sentenced Jon to go live with one of his best friends and his dog for the rest of his life oh no it’s not like that’s what he wanted not the throne
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,"......  
I mean, I think everything that happened basically makes sense.  I just think it was kind of rushed.  


Bran did very little in the entire season, and they had to rush to make Tyrion suggest having Bran as king WHILE he was on trial for treason WHILE everyone decided what to do about Jon.  Jon had to make a fateful decision, the council had to make the most important decision of the series...  


What were the consequences of Varys' actions in beginning of the previous episode?  What about how Jon is the rightful ruler and many people know it?  Does Arya give a proper goodbye to Gendry?  I feel like this all could have worked well if it wasn't so rushed"
8,6,The Iron Throne,I can just picture the Night's Watch walking around the forests picking up trash with the pointy end of their swords now that the White Walkers are destroyed....
8,6,The Iron Throne,Why is Jon allowed unsupervised meetings with a traitor?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"PET THE DOG, EVERYTHING IS FORGIVEN"
8,6,The Iron Throne,The writing may have sucked but thank god the acting never did. I respect the hell out of the cast for giving it their all.
8,6,The Iron Throne,The last time we'll ever hear this theme live on tv again
8,6,The Iron Throne,Robyn Arryn got hot? The most surprising twist yet.
8,6,The Iron Throne,LMAO the leaks were real holy shit
8,6,The Iron Throne,Bran 'sure the North can be independent I don't give a fuck im the three eyed raved ..jesus i just wanna get high'
8,6,The Iron Throne,"""People incapable of guilt, usually do have a good time "" R. Cohle. 

The ultimate villain was Bran the deceitful. He knew everything and how things will end and he didn't do anything because the outcome advantage him and his house. Jon was never a real stark and he paid the price for believe that he was."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I'm waiting for Season 9:
Drogon takes Daenerys' body to Kinvara, the Red Priestess of Volantis, who brings her back to life. Danny returns to Westeros for revenge, and this time she's really mad!"
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,I just want a spin-off where Arya discovers America
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I guess the reason why they don't have a Master of Laws, Master of War, and Master of Whisperers is that they don't have enough main characters that fit those roles."
8,6,The Iron Throne,One last thing just dawned on me. That means the Targaryen line dies with Jon?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"The cinematography this season absolutely blew me away! They definitely deserve an Emmy for that. 

Emilia Clarke’s acting was absolutely amazing. She has come a long way since season 1. Her face was so expressive, all you had to do was look at her and you could see every emotion she was feeling."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Soooo, in the last episode the Red Keep basically collapsed on Jaime and Cersei, yet Tyrion was able to trot downstairs and find them under one conveniently allocated pile of bricks?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Brienne didn't even let the ink dry??? Worst part of the series!!!
8,6,The Iron Throne,***GHOST GOT HIS PETS. WE SHALL NOT RIOT.***
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,Brans about to make that whole castle handicap accessible
8,6,The Iron Throne,I guess Bronn did get Highgarden after all.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Me: stab her Jon! Quickly! 
Jon: *stabs Dany* 
Me: *Pikachu face*"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Drogon pulled a fucking Shenron and resurrected thousands of fucking Unsullied, hundreds of fucking Dothraki who were supposed to be DEAD. GONE. Melisandre's prophecy was pretty much fucking wrong cause the only green eyes Arya closed were probably Gendrys before she fucked him. We didn't get to see how Grey Worm reacted to Jon killing Dany, cause yeah let's time skip 3 fucking weeks into the plot and give everyone a headache. Shit was rushed like a bitch"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So Bran becomes king now because he has his own throne, am I right?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Did everyone just forget that Jon is the rightful fucking heir?
8,6,The Iron Throne,So the whole secret that Jon Snow was the legitimate heir to the throne didn't even needed to exist. He could have just been her boyfriend and killed her out of guilt. What the fuck was the benefit of that. And the dragons?! Why? All for nothing. AAAAAAND where the f are the dothraki? Are you telling me all those barbaric men are okay with blending in in Westeros?
8,6,The Iron Throne,Samwell didn’t say goodbye to Jon? They were best friends since season 1 and supposedly going to name his child after him.
8,6,The Iron Throne,We didn't even get to see Arya use her human face mask this season.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I thought the great council meeting should have played out better and discussed all candidates for the throne. why not jon snow, why not gendry? i thought this part was rushed."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"In Tyrion's trial, why was the topic of Jon being a Targaryen not discussed? He did kill his queen but he was still the rightful heir to the throne. And no one brought this up? Not even Sansa?

And the other Lords of six kingdoms just agreed to Sansa's demand for seperate Winterfell? Why can't others be King of their kingdoms? Winterfell is seperate and Brandon Stark is the King of remaining six kingdoms??   
WTF D&D. This season makes me more eager for the last book. So many unanswered ques.."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Looks like Jon should have fired up Duolingo and chosen High Valerian or Dothraki in order to understand Dany's speech.
8,6,The Iron Throne,">Literally puts a Stark on the throne

""The north will not stand for this. We must be independent""

*WHAT*"
8,6,The Iron Throne,So you mean to tell me for the past 8 seasons people have been killing for the Throne and now no one wants it lmaaoo
8,6,The Iron Throne,"WTF, Jon justifying Dany's actions. 

Jesus."
8,6,The Iron Throne,A living surveillance system will be king
8,6,The Iron Throne,I'm so confused. Is this actually the last episode? If this aired on YouTube as a parody i would have believed it.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Did anyone else get the takeaway that Bran orchestrated it? ""That's why I came all this way."""
8,6,The Iron Throne,Didn’t even get to see a send off between Jon and Sam?
8,6,The Iron Throne,Am I the only one that noticed that greyworm beat tyrian to the top the stairs and he stayed behind to decapitate 6 men after tyrian left?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"“Try telling Sansa” 

Oh I’m glad she still exist here."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"No one is talking about the grass sprouting up in the scene north of the wall. Like... Since the NK was killed, is the north free of the perpetual winter it's been stuck in for thousands of years? Was that magic or something?

That shot of the grass has to mean something, right?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"“I don’t want to be king.”

5 min ago: “That’s why I came all the way here.”

Uhh wtf??"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I'm going to miss all of you!  And now our watch ends.

I wish you good fortune on the shows to come."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"“No ones really happy, which is why it’s a good compromise, I suppose” Tyrion summarizing this episode for us 😂"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Sansa hid from the undead, and stayed home against Cersei, so of course she votes to send Jon away."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"If the north is an independent kingdom now, cant Jon just live there peacefully?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Thought Dany would have some better final words than ""I can count to 20"" :S"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I was hoping we would see our true king, The Night King, walk out of that forest, but I was disappointed."
8,6,The Iron Throne,One thing I did like about the finale is how it ended with House Stark just like how it began.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Where Arya white horse
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I guess D&D decided to adopt the ""Jon doesnt want the throne so we wont mention his heritage anymore"" policy. + I liked it when he said love is the death of duty because Aemon was also a Targ who rejected his legacy"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"All the bullshit aside and forgetting that Dany's turn was a little underdeveloped, I think the scene where Dany comes to see her dream turn to a reality, Jon putting a knife through her and Drogon melting the Iron Throne and taking Dany with him was executed perfectly. At least this scene was done right. 

&#x200B;

Now, the bullshit - I kinda like that Jon was sent to the wall to keep the peace, the scene where he walks off with the Wildlings at the end was pretty cool and I like that Jon is a dark knight, the hero we don't deserve, the one we know should really be the king - it's a nice finish. If he had a bit more to do with the night king's defeat it would have been even more awesome.

&#x200B;

The idea that the North becomes independent, Bran becomes the King (despite the fact the Iron Throne is melted now!) and that the new system doesn't make sense at all to me. Anyone with half a fucking brain can see this does not equal peace. I love Tyrion but I don't get how he just comes out of prison and starts dictating who should be king and how the new leader gets chosen."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Imagine building a character's secret family heritage for 8 seasons only for it to disappear on the last episode
8,6,The Iron Throne,"No matter how this ends, it has been an adventure the last few years with you all.


And now our watch has ended."
8,6,The Iron Throne,I would LOVE for someone to tell me how a prisoner can start telling people how and who to elect as king. lol fucking hell is that
8,6,The Iron Throne,Why the fuck is there a nights watch if all the white walkers are dead and wildlings aren't a threat anymore
8,6,The Iron Throne,So Bran is king because...stories? What the actual fuck I’m losing brain cells
8,6,The Iron Throne,And Arya discovers the Americas....
8,6,The Iron Throne,Ghost finally got the Pats he deserved. Good doggo
8,6,The Iron Throne,He pet the dog!!!!!!!!
8,6,The Iron Throne,SIR PODRICK PAYNE
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Tfw you realize Bran orchestrated season 8 to end up ruler of the 6 kingdoms

Edit: *6 kingdoms"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"What was the point of Arya being a faceless man, she never really used it except to kill old man Walder Frey"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Robin arrived only when he heard about he powers of the giant’s milk 🥛
8,6,The Iron Throne,The Lord of Light brought Jon back to kill Dany.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Why wasn't Bronn (of the blackwater) arrested/executed for punching Tyrion and blackmailing Jamie and Tyrion after the battle was won? He has no allies or loyalty, is of no strategic importance to the realm, and clearly will kill anyone he needs to to get a little bit richer and more powerful ... he is a threat more than anything at this point ..."
8,6,The Iron Throne,What was the point of Jon being a Targ? Like besides stressing a few people out what was the fucking point??
8,6,The Iron Throne,Bran said nothing this whole time knowing thousands would die in KL because he knew it would result in him being King... the real villain of the entire series
8,6,The Iron Throne,"S8E5: 

White horse: “come, Arya.  I have a quest for you. You must avenge this town and bring death to the tyrant who burned the innocent. It fits perfectly with your character!”

Arya: “cool, lets do this” *rides off into the distance majestically*

S8E6:

Arya: *Abandon Quest*"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So let me get this straight, Jon snow finding out he was a Targaryen which was a major plot point that got revealed over 2-3 seasons had no impact whatsoever on the ending of the show and he just ended up back at the wall?

Yea what the fuck."
8,6,The Iron Throne,The lord of light brought Jon back for this?  Lol
8,6,The Iron Throne,"lol, Sansa was like, “fuck that, the North is free.”"
8,6,The Iron Throne,I tried so hard to defend the last episode.. I really did... But this is some other shit all together
8,6,The Iron Throne,I'd laugh my ass off if he stood up.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"since Bran just let the North break away with no resistance, what is stopping the rest of the noble houses from declaring their independence? is Bran going to be willing to forcefully subjugate them if that happens? is this not just a recipe for political disintegration?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,BTW GOOD PEOPLE OF THIS SUB THE LEAKS WERE RIGHT
8,6,The Iron Throne,Can someone explain to me why Arya has turned into Christopher Columbus all of a sudden?
8,6,The Iron Throne,Worst writing ever most scenes were an insult to what this show has been
8,6,The Iron Throne,Best part of this episode was Ghost.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Well, Jon actually avoided the throne like he wanted, and he gets to spend his life in peace, with the people who admire and respect him, and with his best friends, Tormund and Ghost. 


And, of course Sansa wanted the North to be independent - it was an opportunity for her to be the queen.



In the end, a lot of characters got what they wanted."
8,6,The Iron Throne,DnD last Sunday around midnight: “hey Kit we need you to come film an extra scene...what is it?...we need you to come film a scene with yer dog”
8,6,The Iron Throne,The best acting this episode was from Drogon
8,6,The Iron Throne,Arya = Christopher Columbus???
8,6,The Iron Throne,“Why do you think I’m here.”  So I guess Bran was playing the long game...
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I would definitely watch another season just to see what the gangs up to.

I don't think any amount of closure will ever be sufficient."
8,6,The Iron Throne,My biggest problem is that it didn't really seem like an ending. Just an episode to set up spinoffs if HBO wants them. For a show that I've admired for having the balls to do some crazy shit this episode just seems out of place.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Now why does Jon have to take the black if grey worm and the unsullied are leaving??
8,6,The Iron Throne,"When Bran said he is the TER and he can't be Lord of anything, he meant he won't be the Lord, he will be the King."
8,6,The Iron Throne,are we forgetting that in naath are poisonous butterflies that kill everyone foreign?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I really wish this season was dealing with the white walkers and what-have-you, while the next season would have focused on taking King's landing. I feel like that would give the show to breathe and give some character development. The season seems kind of rushed, as well as some illogical things that happened, such as the dragon dying due to the ships and their dragon killing bows, but in the next episode or so, she solos all of the ships and bows with just one dragon."
8,6,The Iron Throne,What's the point of a night's watch anymore?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So what exactly are the Night's Watch going to be doing now?

Cleaning up bits of broken wall?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Remember that big reveal that Jon is a targaryen, like it meant something a few seasons back?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,She never sat on the throne LMAOOOOOOO
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Jon Snow is in denial.  
She will kill your sisters.   
She will delight in killing Sansa."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Samwell promoting democracy LMAO
8,6,The Iron Throne,so the person not important enough to be in season 5 is now king lol
8,6,The Iron Throne,Bran is the most boring character in the series I’m so let down it’s beyond words smh
8,6,The Iron Throne,So does the Targaryen line end with Jon?
8,6,The Iron Throne,Where did Arya go on her horse? Rode 2 feet and hopped off?
8,6,The Iron Throne,How much did Bran get paid to sit and stare for a couple of episodes per season?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Honestly, the night king winning and destroying all of humanity would have been the proper ending."
8,6,The Iron Throne,HE PET GHOST! SEASON SAVED
8,6,The Iron Throne,Master of whispers? Are you kidding me? Bran has the internet.
8,6,The Iron Throne,The only thing good about this ep was the fact that Dany died and Drogon went on to melt the Iron Throne cos i feel like he understood dany went out of her mind just so she could gain her position
8,6,The Iron Throne,YOU GUYS HE PET THE DAMN WOLF
8,6,The Iron Throne,I like when Sam suggested Democracy and everyone laughed. Thank the Gods they didn't agree with him
8,6,The Iron Throne,Jon's ending and tbh the whole ending was pretty anticlimatic
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I feel better and thought it was a good ending for Jon. He never wanted the crown. He killed Dany, his love, and will likely never forgive himself. Him going to live out his days in relative peace with Doggo and Bro is legit."
8,6,The Iron Throne,well i'm glad ghost got petted
8,6,The Iron Throne,It's been fun everyone.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Last time on GOT: $$$hit happened
8,6,The Iron Throne,HAHA DEMOCRACY HAHAHA
8,6,The Iron Throne,#WHY ARE YOU SENDING AWAY THE RIGHTFUL MOTHERFUCKING HEIR
8,6,The Iron Throne,If you told me a month ago that I would give this little of a shit about the finale I'd have called you crazy.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Someone needs to give Dany a dictionary cause sis has no idea what ""Liberating"" means"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Yes Jonbot say she's the queen again Jonbot
8,6,The Iron Throne,Arya about to discover America
8,6,The Iron Throne,So does Jon being Aegon mean nothing or?
8,6,The Iron Throne,And now our watch has ended.
8,6,The Iron Throne,So the Lord of Light brought Jon back to kill Danny?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"How does the Dany wander around by herself to only get killed by Jon Snow? she’s a queen, shouldn’t she have a queens guard??"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Now that Bran is King, I’m sure the small council meetings are gonna be a lot more interesting...

Tyrion: “Bronn, how much can we contribute towards the repair of....” **sees cockroach on table**

Davos: “Nasty thing. I’ll get it.”

Bran: “No need. I’ll take care of it.”

Tyrion: “Your grace, you don’t need to warg into a roach every——“

Bran: **wargs into roach**

Tyrion: **sigh**"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Is Arya going to discover America? (Americos)
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Jon Snow, Queen Slayer, King of the real North."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Peter Dinklage did an incredible job throughout the entire series, but that scene in the catacombs was brutal, raw and honest emotion that cut right through me. Id say he needs some awards or something.

Fuck, i hated Cersi and wasnt a huge fan of Jamie, but he sold me on his loss."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Less than an hour friends
8,6,The Iron Throne,"They're really trying to get Peter Dinklage an Emmy this season, huh?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Plot aside, the camera work on this episode was increible. That Danny with dragon wings shot... Wow!"
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,They look really good for being crushed alive by stone...
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,##Whats the point of Lord of the Light!?
8,6,The Iron Throne,Remember when Jon learned about his true parentage after a life of questioning his identity and worth over being a bastard only for us to learn absolutely nothing about how this has impacted him on any kind of emotional level whatsoever
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Is ""Samwell Tarly wrote the Song of Ice and Fire"" the only correct theory prior to this season?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"What exactly is the point of the Nights Watch now? Jon can basically invite the wildlings over for dinner at Castle Black, got fuck all else to do"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Welp time to forget this season ever happened and wait for the book.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Thank God, he actually gave ghost some attention this time.

It's quite possibly the only thing that I was happy about in this episode."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Jon gets to be the king of the northlings. Sansa gets to be Eddard. Arya gets to be Christopher Columbus.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Varys died for nothing
8,6,The Iron Throne,It seems more like Jon rejoined the wildlings than the nights watch.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Arya finds out she just ends up in the east because the world isn't flat
8,6,The Iron Throne,sansa is probably the only character who got the arc ending she deserved in this episode
8,6,The Iron Throne,The writers deemed Bran so inconsequential that they went an entire season without him. Now he's the fucking king.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion’s OCD was the best part of this episode
8,6,The Iron Throne,"We did get to watch all the main characters laugh at the concept of democracy. Probably 2nd best scene.   


Best scene goes to Tyrion and his OCD."
8,6,The Iron Throne,*Chaos isn’t a pit...chaos is a wheelchair*
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Bran went from ""I don't want anymore"" to ""Hell yeah I'll be the king! Su-weeet!"""
8,6,The Iron Throne,The unsullied are headed off to Naarth... Okay.  Where are the Dothraki going?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So is the nights watch not a thing? They just said that to hush Grey Worm, and Jon gets to go and live beyond the wall as a free man. Or was he just leading them home?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"And after Tyrion and the other Lords decided to anoint Kings by the council’s decision, the lobbying industry was born."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"“Everything is proceeding as I have forseen...”

-Darth Bran"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Bran: Chaos is a ladder. FTW.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Jamie survived being stabbed in vital organs and internal bleeding only to die from like 20 bricks, rip"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"the winner is Bran? Bran is the fucking king. Are you kidding me?

#?????????????????????????????????????"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"It’s like GRRM gave them 6-7 bullet points of “this generally happens” and they decided to write/film ONLY THOSE BULLET POINTS and literally nothing else. 

What did I just watch?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,The leaks were 100% right. *And they said they filmed multiple endings...*
8,6,The Iron Throne,So glad they rushed through the season so I could watch Tyrion push in chairs.
8,6,The Iron Throne,I just hope they explain the polar bears and smoke monster.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"1 hour and 20 minute final breakdown

45 mins of charecters slowly walking around

5 mins of troops yelling

20 mins of intense stairing

10 mins of actual decent and engaging episode"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Sam's idea wasn't so crazy... I liked it.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Bran playing the long con for the game of thrones
8,6,The Iron Throne,jon’s resurrection and lineage turned out to be pointless lol he’s just going back to the watch to do nothing ???!!!
8,6,The Iron Throne,I'm just going to pretend that the Night King won and this season ended at The Long Night.
8,6,The Iron Throne,I've never been so heartbroken with how poorly a shows finally has been written...I was expecting a horrendous end...I got one that was a thousand times worse that I don't even have words to describe.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Bran should be like “Unsullied are gone; go back to Winterfell, Jon”"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So .. Dany dies in the most anticlimactic way with no guards around her. Greyworm goes from executing prisoners to doing nothing, for reasons, Bran does nothing the past two seasons and becomes king ... 

They just slept walked through all these sometimes very interesting bullet points these past two seasons."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Its really impressive how the writers broke the 4th wall and shat down all our throats for the season finale
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Yo hold up, Tyrion isn't even mentioned in the fucking book? Bullshit, he was Hand to two different monarchs, not to mention his pivotal role in the Battle of the Blackwater."
8,6,The Iron Throne,I need a fucking drink.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Only satisfying character arc is jon petting the dog
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,Spinoff “West of Westeros”
8,6,The Iron Throne,Are yall happy? He pet the fucking dog lmao.
8,6,The Iron Throne,YES HE PET GHOST
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I'm trying to imagine these spin offs

Arya is Sinbad

Sansas is like Downton Abbey

Brans is home improvement

Jon's is Fargo"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So, wait a minute.  Was Jon joining the Freefolk?  Freefolk Ambassador?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,He pet the pup. All sins are forgiven.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Even the dragon couldn't resist how bad the scenario is and flew away.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Greyworm basically just killed all the unsullied by sending them to naarth. Butterflies > worms
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Arya Columbus, the first of her name!"
8,6,The Iron Throne,In the world of ice and fire doesnt it say that all outsiders on Naath die?  Lmao all the unsullied are heading for a death trap
8,6,The Iron Throne,Jon basically said fuck the wall I'm going to go live with the wildling.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Can someone explain to me what John is going to do north of the wall? Is he like Mance now?
8,6,The Iron Throne,He petted ghost. Season saved.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So the unsullied head out to Naarth. WHO IS MAKING JON ACTUALLY GO TO THE WALL!? Is there literally anyone who would stop him from just saying ""uh, nope...don't feel like it."" 

And why is there a watch?! Whom do they fight? Do they just stand on a busted ass wall and wave to the wildlings? I mean, they're friends now. I'm so confused"
8,6,The Iron Throne,">Why do you think I came all this way?

ARE. YOU. FUCKING. KIDDING. ME."
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,And bran went on to be one of the most ruthless leaders in Westeros history
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Read the leaks and still was somehow surprised and disappointed that D&D actually followed through with Bran becoming king

Fuck this fan fiction bullshit. Seen better writing on AO3"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Sansa coming in with that Northexit.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Sam 'lets use democracy and let everyone have a say :) '

(AHAHAHAHAHHAHA)"
8,6,The Iron Throne,THE NIGHTS WATCH OOLLLLLOLLOLLLOLLOOLLL THIS FUCKING SHOW
8,6,The Iron Throne,What the actual stupid fuck????
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Oh God, I'm crying from laughing so hard"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Episode 3 was the real finale.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So Varys died without sending letters or he sent letters and no one gave a shit. And suddenly no one cares about king lineage of birth air to the throne, that would never have happened in the real world."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"1000th commander of the nights watch...Jon snow. Two terms, nonconsecutive, like grover cleveland"
8,6,The Iron Throne,[removed]
8,6,The Iron Throne,“No one is happy” our boy Tyrion speaking the truth. No one could have summed up how we all feel better.
8,6,The Iron Throne,They don’t answer half of the lingering questions and we’re still getting filler by watching Brienne write in a book for 2 minutes
8,6,The Iron Throne,Honestly worst fucking season in the entire goddamn series. They fucked the last season so hard. Such a disappointment.
8,6,The Iron Throne,FUCK THIS SHIT
8,6,The Iron Throne,What the hell am I watching right now?
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,"* Expected the ending of this show to not be a hot pile of garbage
* Ending of this show turned out to be a hot pile of garbage

Expectations = Subverted

#Bravo D&D. Bravo"
8,6,The Iron Throne,How the fuck is the tower of the hand still standing? Didn't it fall into the fucking sea?
8,6,The Iron Throne,what was the point of jon’s true parentage? why make such a huge deal and hype it up for seasons for no payoff of any kind?
8,6,The Iron Throne,So what do the nights watch do now?
8,6,The Iron Throne,Remember Rickon? I don’t think his siblings do
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,Ghost got the rubs he deserved.  All is well with the realm.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Wait, did they rebuild Kings Landing, or was the small council chamber just magically not destroyed? 🙄"
8,6,The Iron Throne,I feel like I have more questions than answers...
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Now that it's over, its clear.





Noone wins the game of thrones, especially not the fucking fans."
8,6,The Iron Throne,So is there just like a random dragon flying around now
8,6,The Iron Throne,I didn’t binge watch 7 seasons for Jon to ride into the sunset with the wildlings without anyone knowing he is the rightful king.......EXCUSE ME!!!! I NEED TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Well Jon and Tormund are back together that’s alright with me
8,6,The Iron Throne,I feel very emotional right now. My favorite show just ended and it ended with...a whimper? But I don't mean that in a bad way necessarily. I'm glad there wasn't this big war or screaming match or bloodshed. Just a dignified kill and a dignified council to decide the fate of the people. I don't mind the way things turned out. It's just the execution that I mind. The rushed writing. But honestly this episode really did tug at my heartstrings. Those last shots were amazing and really made me feel something. Everything felt final. I'm a little high rn so I'm not very coherent lol. Might be more in the morning. But all in all I didn't hate it at all. Just wish the events leading up to this were better written and better handled.
8,6,The Iron Throne,What's with that Edmure Tully scene was cringe!
8,6,The Iron Throne,And Dany’s death was so quick like damn
8,6,The Iron Throne,I legit would have picked ghost over bran
8,6,The Iron Throne,Jon should’ve returned North of his own accord.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"What about the Dothrakis? I thought there are still 40-50k of them left?! 

How about Dario? Wouldn’t he gather up an army from Mareen and sail to avenge his queen?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,The only reason Arya is in search of a new continent is because she needs to add to her face collection.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Dany: *burns  all the people of King's Landing*

Also Dany: we have freed the people of King's Landing from a tyrant"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Why the fuck would any of these soldiers who are loyal to Dany give a fuck about who any of these other people are once she was killed? They would go on a fucking rampage, not invite Sansa and the Prince of Dorne to talk things out."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Once Dany was gone, the whole thing just devolved into...boredom. It was unreal how long some scenes dragged on. 

7 seasons worth of build-up (and I guess season 8 if you want to include it) for Dany to be killed and Drogon to just peace out (I have a hard time believing he wouldn't at least eat Jon after that). 

Bran does nothing the entire season and suddenly he's king. Great.

And don't even get me started on Jon...what a letdown. 

2/10 for Brienne writing how Jamie died and Ghost getting the pets."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"""Why do you think I came all this way?""  Shut tv off."
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,"The Night’s Watch is now literally watching the night now that the white walkers are gone and will eventually lay the groundwork for modern astronomy made possible by gazing into the night sky for centuries.

Arya sails west of Westeros into unchartered territory and will go on to discover a land full of red Indians. 500 years later, white walkers who later came to be known as white men invaded that land, and after a long civil war, became the United States of America. 

Drogon had a moment of awakening and burned down the iron throne - the root cause of 8 seasons of fighting, blood, anguish, tears and death. Bran said he was last spotted in the east, which was where Drogon discovered China, and saw the Chinese doing the exact same seven kingdoms shit that led to his mother being killed except it was called Three Kingdoms. The Chinese were terrified and started carving dragons into everything they built out of respect for Drogon."
8,6,The Iron Throne,We have time for Tryrion to push and set 6 chairs but we cut away Jon revealing his parentage to sansa and arya.
8,6,The Iron Throne,'Ser Podric' - The only enjoyable moment.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"daenerys: I'm going to break the wheel

King now has 2 wheels"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"""no one is very happy"" - Tyrion

sums up this shitshow of a season."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Are you kidding me? Jon Snow saves humanity TWICE! One from the night walkers and the second from Dany and he gets sent to the wall, why!? And what will they be guarding!!???? I’m pissed."
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,"For what it’s worth, I have enjoyed this journey with you, Reddit. No matter what comes."
8,6,The Iron Throne,I think Arya will wear Greyworm's face and kill Dany.
8,6,The Iron Throne,This really needed 2 seasons to develop. Dany has went from Queen liberty to Hitler in 3 episodes.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Jon is worse than Reek right now
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Tyrion hitting Jon with the ""First they came for the slavers, and I did not speak up because I was not a slaver"""
8,6,The Iron Throne,Can I vote Drogon for best performance in the post-episode survey?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Jon to the everyone: ""Yeah so Dany said she was going to go to the gas station for cigarettes..."""
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Welcome to the survivor's circle, Tyrion."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Lol aww poor Uncle got roasted by a simple “Please Sit”
8,6,The Iron Throne,LeTs TaLk AbOuT dEmOcRaCy
8,6,The Iron Throne,Darn...where is lord of highgarden ser Bronn?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"The show has become a joke, wth"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"This is as close to democracy as you're going to get, Sam. Roll with it."
8,6,The Iron Throne,I don’t care about who rules the 7 kingdoms at least we got to know for certain that Bran is a limp dick
8,6,The Iron Throne,8 years to this fucking joke. What am I even watching
8,6,The Iron Throne,Where the fuck did Edmure Tully come from?
8,6,The Iron Throne,That is the wheel [chair] our queen wanted to break
8,6,The Iron Throne,Sam just tried inventing Democracy. F in chat.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Will the queen be a bird
8,6,The Iron Throne,What the actual fuck is the reasoning behind this bullshit ?
8,6,The Iron Throne,there’s no wall for jon to even defend
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Jon returning to Castle Black.

&#x200B;

""Aw shit, here we go again...."""
8,6,The Iron Throne,"This is siiickk. I’m literally sick watching this shit.

Bran 2 minutes ago: why do you think I came all the way here

Bran now: I didn’t want to be king

lmao"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Grey Worm's face while everyone is calling Bran king has been my face since after the BoW.
What happened to the writing we used to know.
Fuck.
It's like if they don't have something to fall back on they have no idea what to do."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"**What's west of Westeros?**

***Westworld.***"
8,6,The Iron Throne,So Jon's parentage meant fucking nothing in the end.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"They made peace with the wildlings, there are no white walkers so what the fuck is the Knight's Watch watching?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,So then... what was the point of making Jon a Targ?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So D&D was really like,

“So let’s make Arya important for one scene and then just have her do nothing. Sounds perfect!”"
8,6,The Iron Throne,The Iron Wheelchair
8,6,The Iron Throne,"This episode made two criminal mistakes. 

1. Sucking.

2. Being boring while sucking."
8,6,The Iron Throne,“You were exactly where you were supposed to be” this is so fucking corny
8,6,The Iron Throne,This is worse than the ending of Battle Star Galactica
8,6,The Iron Throne,"""Died ~~protecting his Queen~~ pointlessly after throwing away seven seasons of character development."""
8,6,The Iron Throne,Is the ending bittersweet because it's sad the show is over but we're grateful that it won't carry on like this?
8,6,The Iron Throne,So how is Bran gonna get around the castle given that it's like 90% stairs?
8,6,The Iron Throne,This episode sucks but at least Robin Arryn is a fucking stud now
8,6,The Iron Throne,WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
8,6,The Iron Throne,aw man they made podrick the royal wheelchair pusher
8,6,The Iron Throne,"King Bran the Broken? 

&#x200B;

Jesus, that's a bit insensitive."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Now the night king is dead why is there even a nightswatch
8,6,The Iron Throne,Imagine thinking this episode is good
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Not the worst series finale I've seen, but is anyone actually satisfied?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I'm struggling to find the ""sweet"" in this ""bittersweet"" ending"
8,6,The Iron Throne,The pets that were promised.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"THE PETTING HAPPENED

JON IS REDEEMED"
8,6,The Iron Throne,So...is Westeros technically ruled by a foreign lord with the North now independent? Why? Also the starks literally rule everything now after ruling nothing yesterday.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So, Sansa being  a queen is not a problem to the northern lords."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Wait.... What? Did they just give the realm (6 Kingdoms) to the Three Eyed Raven? I thought he was the persona of the children of the forest, does that mean that this was their end game all along? I REALLY hope the books are not this disappointing. (Well, It is an ending).

Edit: clarification of the realm"
8,6,The Iron Throne,The Night King died for this? SHAME.
8,6,The Iron Throne,The Starks won the iron wheelchair
8,6,The Iron Throne,THAT SHIT ASS CROWN THOUGH FOR SANSA
8,6,The Iron Throne,I bet Bran’s rule will involve a lot of intense staring
8,6,The Iron Throne,Wish there was a follow up to the 'faceless men plot' what happened to the dude that taught arya everything?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Well, At least Bronn got his Castle"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Honestly I really think Jon should’ve had the iron throne. I know it would’ve been predictable but at least everyone would’ve been happy with Jon. So you tell us he’s the heir and he doesn’t even take it like ok.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Bran finally got a decent haircut at Kings Landing.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Well my guess that the NK would show up at the very end and produce a deed for Westeros, and we find out he's actually a real estate investor that bought up the land in the early days at a steal  is smashed."
8,6,The Iron Throne,its so creepy that bran is king
8,6,The Iron Throne,Alternate ending: Ser Davos tells everyone to just chill and they do.
8,6,The Iron Throne,That shot of Dany with the wings behind her was Zack Snyder worthy obvious symbolism.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Podgod doesn't get to use the rod anymore
8,6,The Iron Throne,okay but wheres hot pie
8,6,The Iron Throne,I'm interested in whats west of Westeros. I'm interested in what they may find.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Just finished finally and i am surprised they were able to make me dislike as many people as I did at the end of this show. Also, why did Jamie defend briann's honor so often only to take her virginity and ride off the next day to die with his sociopathic sister. Yeah real great friend sir Jamie.  Really did a nice job protecting her from the guy who actually liked her."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I know this episode is bad when I’m reading Reddit while watching it. I’ve never done that before, no lie."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I don't care what anyone says, Watchmen looks fucking great."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"10 years of the show, the books, countless hours imagining how theory after theory will play out. Long months between each season slowly waiting and waiting for the next one to begin. Theres been ups and downs this season and sure they could have done some things better and less rushed and now here we are  the beginning of the end. The end of the drama, violence, betrayals, glory, political games and live or die the end of the road for all the characters that we love and love to hate, the end of westeros. To all the actors, producers, extras, crew and all those that made it possible and of course to the man himself George. R. Martin thank you. Its been one hell of a journey to follow and to you reddit its been fun to watch alongside you all. Our watch has ended. I hope you all enjoy it."
8,6,The Iron Throne,How does she still have so much unsullied and ANY dothraki?!!!!!
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Tyrion gave zero fucks for his *queen*. Damn, I love him."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Drogon trying to wake Dany up just crushed my heart
8,6,The Iron Throne,"""There's nothing more powerful than a good story""
I wish we could've gotten a good ending to one of the greatest story's ever told."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I have a few questions about the series as a whole that never got answered

What caused the doom of Valeria

Wtf are the stonemen

What is in the far north where the white walkers lived

Who was the woman in the metal mask that dany met in essos

What does podrick do to get all these women"
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,What was the point of the Arya gaining the face snatching ability?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Huh, Varys really did spend all day writing one scroll.

I guess Bran really did spend that whole time warging into the crows, while Theon fought for his life.

I guess no one ruled for the weeks Tyrion was in prison.

I guess Jon being Targaryen was pointless.

Huh."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Am I the only one fuming. What the hell was the point of Jon being a Targ? It meant nothing at all. 

Like what in the hell is this?

Not to mention Bran was freaking useless. 3ER that did jack and shit."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Wtf is this shit
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,their queen just died and the unsullied and the dothraki's go back home like nothing happened? The scenes after Dany's death was so anticlimactic
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Things I do like: Arya refusing being a lady and exploring the rest of the world being a badass. And Sansa carrying on through all the trauma she has experienced and keeping the north free! And tormund showing up, and ghost pet!"
8,6,The Iron Throne,...bruh literally 5+ people at this roundtable had a better arc than bran
8,6,The Iron Throne,GOT blew a 7 season lead.
8,6,The Iron Throne,They uploaded the parody episode instead of the actual one
8,6,The Iron Throne,">why do you think I came all this way?

WHAT? HE *WANTS* THE CROWN? HE HAS ACTIVELY COVETED THE CROWN?

This is horseshit he has ZERO INTERESTS OR DESIRES HE HAS BEEN A SHELL OF A HUMAN BEING FOR SEASONS WHAT THE FUCK DUDE"
8,6,The Iron Throne,So what was the fucking point of revealing who Jon was?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"So Jon dies. Gets re-born

Reclaims the fucking north. 

SAVES the fucking world. **TWICE**. 

Is proven to be Targaryen.

And gets fucked like this. 

Wow"
8,6,The Iron Throne,What's the point of telling Jon his heritage
8,6,The Iron Throne,I'm very disappointed we never got to see Arya use her many faces again... was just completely forgotten
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Hold the door, I just realized. Bran said he’s not a Stark and he can’t be lord of anything but now he’s “Brandon of House Stark, king of the 6 kingdoms?” Ehh a girl doesn’t buy this"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"How the hell can Sansa declare the north’s independence (especially since the north was wrecked by the army of the dead and is really weak), but no other lords/ladies try to declare their independence then??? What Sansa did should have blown up those talks to have Bran be king but instead no one said anything!"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Before this begins, does anyone want to get out?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"That shot of Drogon’s wings behind Dany was magnificent.

Edit: behind* not begins."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Arya is legit the best sister for not saying “I told you so”
8,6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion is all of us at this point. He just wants to drink and die.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Tyrion resigned like a boss.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"now whatever happens, I do feel Kings Landing can now get newer more modern buildings, its time for a new Kings Landing yes..gentrification for Kings Landing no matter what happens we can make a  more modern Kings Landing..with toilets inside!"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Jon: “so are we the baddies?”
8,6,The Iron Throne,"No one:


Drogon: ain’t nobody sitting on the iron throne now"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Drogon melted the throne, took her body, and flew away. Post your fanfiction AO3 like everyone else. Keep it off my tv."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Why does a dragon have concept of what caused his mother’s death
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Drogon out here like ""If mom can't rule then nobody rules"""
8,6,The Iron Throne,LMAOOOOOO BRAN THE BROKEN I CAN’T
8,6,The Iron Throne,The boy who lived! Harry Potter!
8,6,The Iron Throne,BRANNN!!?!? *soulja boy voice*
8,6,The Iron Throne,Bran the Broken has me cracking up unfortunately.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"""Why do you think I came all this way?""

You're in a wheelchair dude. I don't think you have that much say in it if somebody decides to just start pushing you south."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"i guess its ok the iron throne got smelted, bran brought his own chair"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Remember AZOR AHAI? neither do I
8,6,The Iron Throne,bran goes on to be the most ruthless bloodiest ruler ever
8,6,The Iron Throne,"WTF EVEN IS THE NIGHT'S WATCH GUARDING AT THIS POINT??? Did jon just legit become like the King Beyond the Wall? but didn't the wall, like, collapse? This just sounds like lazy writing and logical shit."
8,6,The Iron Throne,What stops Jon from walking across the wall and living his best life.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Why TF is there still a Night’s Watch????
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Tyrion: You have to go back to the Night's Watch. No one is happy about this 

Jon: THANK GOD! I get to go back to the one place were I was happy."
8,6,The Iron Throne,So...what’s the night watch looking out for now 😒
8,6,The Iron Throne,so what about the letters varys sent?? nothing? everyone just completely forgot about jon?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Tyrion says Jon needs to go to the wall to keep the peace with the unsullied, but Unsullied now Sail off to essos. So who is to make sure Jon doesn’t casually bounce out of the wall ? I don’t get it"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Who the fuck are the nights watch even defending against anymore?
8,6,The Iron Throne,If the Unsullied are sailing to Naarth why would Jon be sent to the wall? D&D forgot their adderall
8,6,The Iron Throne,SAM DID IN FACT WRITE THE BOOK
8,6,The Iron Throne,"You see jon everything happened for a reason, all this violence and climax was for you to go be with a bunch of dudes doing nothing with no meaning or purpose"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Brienne scene was legitimately good and finally feels like Jamie has the ending his character deserves.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Bran, what’s west of Westeros? Problem solved."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"in the end, the real game of thrones was friendship"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Compromise: Something where everyone is unhappy

D&D, 2019"
8,6,The Iron Throne,I fucking love Bronn
8,6,The Iron Throne,Making Bronn the master of coin is like making an oil lobbyist head of EPA
8,6,The Iron Throne,Way too rushed.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"For real though, is the red keep wheel chair friendly🤔?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Where the hell did drogon fly to
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Bran: I'm sure I can find Drogon.

Bran: (Does nothing to find Drogon)

Gods, what a satisfying ending."
8,6,The Iron Throne,OUR BOY GHOST FINALLY GOT HIS PETS
8,6,The Iron Throne,“You will take no wife” he said nothing of husbands.
8,6,The Iron Throne,I love Sansa’s dress. She got an upgrade
8,6,The Iron Throne,Brienne finishing jaime's chapter has me crying
8,6,The Iron Throne,Jon Snow says fuck the knight's watch! Wildling it is.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Best scene of the season was Sansa wearing that crown, everything else was trash."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Sooo...the Dothraki are just chillin there now?
8,6,The Iron Throne,Dany blew a 3 dragon lead
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Entire season was designed to set up spinoffs. 

Smh"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Won’t the unsullied house not last long?
8,6,The Iron Throne,So after all that I just don't give a Fuck about the ending
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Also, why the hell is the Nightwatch is still there? Their job is not exist anymore..."
8,6,The Iron Throne,I’ve got one good thing: Peter Dinklage’s acting. When he saw Jaime and Cersei my heart broke.
8,6,The Iron Throne,What is the point of the wall and the men of the nights watch if there is no threat???
8,6,The Iron Throne,Last scene should of been the dragon flying in the distance and it fades out on hearing the dragon roar.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Robb Stark: “So this is what I died for??🙃🙃”
8,6,The Iron Throne,Bruh. Who fixed the wall?! Shit looked taller than before.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Sansa: No more bending the knee! (Except to me)
8,6,The Iron Throne,GRR Martin recently talked about that it would have a bittersweet ending. What was bittersweet about that ending at all? All lived happily ever after by all accounts
8,6,The Iron Throne,"When he stabbed Dany I was like oh we’re doing this now, oh okay. 

And then I thought Drogon was going to eat her."
8,6,The Iron Throne,They really gonna do Yara dirty like that huh
8,6,The Iron Throne,When Bran accepts being a king to the whole realm so willingly but refuses to be a sibling cause he is the “three eyed raven”
8,6,The Iron Throne,I was sort of hoping the night king would merge out of Bran and be like gotcha and take over the realm
8,6,The Iron Throne,The only thing I'm confused about in this episode is when Grey Worm says that Tyrion serving as hand of the king for the rest of his life and fixing his mistakes is not enough justice. As far as I can tell there's nothing else in the episode that shows that Tyrion received any additional punishment? Did Grey Worm just forget about not being satisfied?
8,6,The Iron Throne,All hail bran the broken
8,6,The Iron Throne,"All hail Bran the broken. He was sitting on throne all the while, we didn't even realize!"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I know he did actually do stuff throughout the show, but it kinda feels like Bran won the throne the same way Luigi wins in those Mario Party videos, by doing nothing."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Soooo... what became of Gilly and little Sam? If Big Sam is Grand Maester Democracy, I’m guessing he’s not married? Are they in his ancestral home with his mum?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I'm kind of sad now that it's over however it ended. No matter how the last few seasons went this was a world that amazed me it had characters that I loved and had gotten attached to, and now it's over. I've read the books, but at this point almost given up hope for the last 2 i've been waiting so long. I'll probably try to just stop following any news rumours of when it's gonna come so that one day if it does come it'll be a surprise."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Totally serious question: How are the unsullied going to start their own house? How would that work?
8,6,The Iron Throne,i think cersei would rather be dead than see the boy her brother crippled be nominated to be king
8,6,The Iron Throne,The only thing they didn’t rush in the finale was setting up the spin off series for the adventure of Arya
8,6,The Iron Throne,‪when i die i want the writers for season 8 to lower me into my grave so they can let me down one last time ‬
8,6,The Iron Throne,So Jon is still alive as the true heir to the throne and everyone just...forgot? Then why did his parentage matter?
8,6,The Iron Throne,[deleted]
8,6,The Iron Throne,I feel so bad for the actors who are probably way more invested in this than us.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"We waited 2 years for this, I’m going to try to pretend this season never happened and make another ending in my head"
8,6,The Iron Throne,What's the point of Jon being Targaryen?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Brienne was real nice to jamie writing in the book. I would have been much more petty and written something like had a small penis and died a coward

Edit: i know what she should have written now

'Died doing what he loved, his sister."""
8,6,The Iron Throne,Why did they close the gate behind John if there's a fcking hole at the end of the wall?!?
8,6,The Iron Throne,[removed]
8,6,The Iron Throne,MAKE YOUR CHOICE THEN??? THATS IT???? 8 SEASONS OF BUILD UP FOR WHO WILL GET THE IRON THRONE AND IT TURNS INTO A WHO GETS TO BE PRESIDENT OF OUR FUCKING DEBATE TEAM DISCUSSION
8,6,The Iron Throne,"When they are trying to figure out who should be king, why is no one mentioning that John is the true heir in the first place???

Why should John get sent to the wall when he was the true kind to the throne in the first place?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"If I knew Game of Thrones was going to end like this, I wouldn’t have created 6 free HBO trial accounts."
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Arya came here to kill herself a queen, and she gon' kill herself a queen, Jon."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Anyone else getting really turned on by Mad Dany?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"LMAO they are actually going to make Bran king, what a fucking JOKE"
8,6,The Iron Throne,No fucking way grey worm let Jon live as a prisoner all that time after he killed Dany
8,6,The Iron Throne,Why the fuck does the Nights watch exist if there are no more white walkers?!?!?!
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Despite my mixed feelings about the ending, I'm happy to have had the opportunity to enjoy such a spectacular show for nearly a decade. This is truly the end of an era. Thank you for the great memories GoT!"
8,6,The Iron Throne,God damn it Peter Dinklage.  You have me wondering who's cutting onions right now.  Superb acting.
8,6,The Iron Throne,I guess the Unsullied and Dothraki forgot they all died in winterfell
8,6,The Iron Throne,So how does Daenerys plan on having generational success with no women followers
8,6,The Iron Throne,I’m truly afraid of Daenerys. God work Emilia.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Jon is thinking with his incestuous penis again
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Ok, so Jon’s really dropping the ball here. He needs to get benched - who else can we bring in for backup?"
8,6,The Iron Throne,The shot of Dany and the dragon wings was so beautiful.
8,6,The Iron Throne,That shot with the dragon wings behind Daenerys? ICONIC.
8,6,The Iron Throne,What’s the fucking plan Jon?????
8,6,The Iron Throne,The iron throne’s death was more dramatic than Daenerys’...
8,6,The Iron Throne,"""Fuck your throne"""
8,6,The Iron Throne,"“You’re my queen” - Jon Snow, 2019"
8,6,The Iron Throne,We thought we would just subvert expectations by having there be no throne
8,6,The Iron Throne,All hail king wheelchair
8,6,The Iron Throne,LOL...that was the nicest and snarkiest way of telling someone to STFU ever....gold.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Sansa: ""Uncle, sit your ass ***down***.""  
Uncle: ""Okay."""
8,6,The Iron Throne,Lol how do we keep Sansa the strong Independent woman? We'll have her not unite her house in this monumental defining moment. She'll be so badass!
8,6,The Iron Throne,Isnt bran supposed to live like thousands of years?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Bran is king? BULLSHIT.
The most useless character is now king? WTF I can’t..I just cant."
8,6,The Iron Throne,LMAOOO Democracy laughed out the window. 😂😂👌
8,6,The Iron Throne,WHY DOES TYRION HAVE ANY SAY IN THIS RIGHT NOW
8,6,The Iron Throne,They got paid millions of dollars to make this......I’m floored
8,6,The Iron Throne,Lol. Oh man. This show. What a shame.
8,6,The Iron Throne,I literally hate this season
8,6,The Iron Throne,This has got to be the worst episode of the series. FUCKING DOGSHIT
8,6,The Iron Throne,I saw the spoilers and thought there was no way it could be true. What the fuck man
8,6,The Iron Throne,"And everyone was like ""well ok the north, you do you"""
8,6,The Iron Throne,"This has got to be some kind of joke
 Smh"
8,6,The Iron Throne,How can a last episode of an epic series be so boring?
8,6,The Iron Throne,Sends Jon to the Nights Watch LOL. This is so bad
8,6,The Iron Throne,Why would they do this? How could they fuck this up like this
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Da fuck? They sent this man's to the Nights Watch. I'm crying.

XD"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"D&D: How can we sidestep the conflict between Sansa and Dany over northern independence?

Skip it."
8,6,The Iron Throne,so... much potential... thrown on to the garbage
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Oh man, I cant believe the leaks were right LOL"
8,6,The Iron Throne,How to destroy eight seasons in 90 minutes
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Hahaha DAE remember Tyrion pissing in season 1? What a brilliant callback! Amazing sense of humour, D&D. 

/s"
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Arya ""Family is like so important""

Also Arya ""Im fucking off for parts unknown. Deuces."
8,6,The Iron Throne,Arya is going to discover America.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"Thought she was gonna write ""took my virginity and bounced."""
8,6,The Iron Throne,Where the fuck is Bronn anyway?!  Did he get Highgarden or not?!
8,6,The Iron Throne,"from bastard

to lord commander

to king

back to steward"
8,6,The Iron Throne,What’s the point of the Night’s watch now?
8,6,The Iron Throne,Unpopular opinion: Bran is the least deserving. He knowingly let tons of people die to become king.
8,6,The Iron Throne,Fuck D&D they should never be hired for another show or movie agian
8,6,The Iron Throne,He should make all those seats wheelchairs in honor of King Bran.
8,6,The Iron Throne,I’m on the cancel HBO subscription train. Who wants in?
8,6,The Iron Throne,Comments so fast you’ll never know i like to lick butt
8,6,The Iron Throne,This is Tumblr fan fic writing with this council.
8,6,The Iron Throne,But where did Drogon take Dany?
8,6,The Iron Throne,"A tremendous 9 years of my life, and 1 shitty. In the end, thank you Game of Thrones."
8,6,The Iron Throne,I wish I hadn’t seen this.
8,6,The Iron Throne,"I love how the Westeros council was basically ""all lords and ladies of Westeros, plus some random dudes and a knight"""
8,6,The Iron Throne,So Ned Stark got beheaded for *all of this*? WTF?!!!
8,6,The Iron Throne,"SO WHATS THE FUCKING POINT OF JON BEING A TARGARYEN, WHAT WAS THE POINT OF HIM BEING THE TRUE HEIR OMFG"
8,6,The Iron Throne,Can we pretend this show ended at season 6?
